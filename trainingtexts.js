const hardy1 = 'A person who differed from the local wayfarers was climbing the steep road which leads through the sea-skirted townlet definable as the Street of Wells, and forms a pass into that Gibraltar of Wessex, the singular peninsula once an island, and still called such, that stretches out like the head of a bird into the English Channel. It is connected with the mainland by a long thin neck of pebbles ‘cast up by rages of the se, and unparalleled in its kind in Europe.The pedestrian was what he looked like--a young man from London and the cities of the Continent. Nobody could see at present that his urbanism sat upon him only as a garment. He was just recollecting with something of self-reproach that a whole three years and eight months had flown since he paid his last visit to his father at this lonely rock of his birthplace, the intervening time having been spent amid many contrasting societies, peoples, manners, and scenes. What had seemed usual in the isle when he lived there always looked quaint and odd after his later impressions. More than ever the spot seemed what it was said once to have been, the ancient Vindilia Island,and the Home of the Slingers. The towering rock, the houses above houses, one man’s doorstep rising behind his neighbour’s chimney, the gardens hung up by one edge to the sky, the vegetables growing on apparently almost vertical planes, the unity of the whole island as a solid and single block of limestone four miles long, were no longer familiar and commonplace ideas.All now stood dazzlingly unique and white against the tinted sea, and the sun flashed on infinitely stratified walls of oolite The melancholy ruins with a distinctiveness that called the eyes to it as strongly as any spectacle he had beheld afar. After a laborious clamber he reached the top, and walked along the plateau towards the eastern village. The time being about two o’clock, in the middle of the summer season, the road was glaring and dusty, and drawing near to his father’s house he sat down in the sun.He stretched out his hand upon the rock beside him. It felt warm. That was the island’s personal temperature when in its afternoon sleep as now. He listened, and heard sounds: whirr-whirr, saw-saw-saw. Those were the island’s snores--the noises of the quarrymen and stone-sawyers. Opposite to the spot on which he sat was a roomy cottage or homestead. Like the island it was all of stone, not only in walls but in window-frames, roof, chimneys, fence, stile, pigsty and stable, almost door. He remembered who had used to live there--and probably lived there now--the Caro family; the ‘roan-mare’ Caros, as they were called to distinguish them from other branches of the same pedigree, there being but half-a-dozen Christian and surnames in the whole island. He crossed the road and looked in at the open doorway. Yes, there they were still. Mrs. Caro, who had seen him from the window, met him in the entry, and an old-fashioned greeting took place between them. A moment after a door leading from the back rooms was thrown open, and a young girl about seventeen or eighteen came bounding in.‘Why, ‘TIS dear Joce!’ she burst out joyfully. And running up to the young man, she kissed him.The demonstration was sweet enough from the owner of such an affectionate pair of bright hazel eyes and brown tresses of hair. But it was so sudden, so unexpected by a man fresh from towns, that he winced'

O, he’s such a fashionable person now--not at all an island man. But there’s no use in talking of it. I wish I was dead!’ Pierston retreated as quickly as he could. He grieved at the incident which had brought such pain to this innocent soul; and yet it was beginning to be a source of vague pleasure to him. He returned to the house, and when his father had come back and welcomed him, and they had shared a meal together, Jocelyn again went out, full of an earnest desire to soothe his young neighbour’s sorrow in a way she little expected; though, to tell the truth, his affection for her was rather that of a friend than of a lover, and he felt by no means sure that the migratory, elusive idealization he called his Love who, ever since his boyhood, had flitted from human shell to human shell an indefinite number of times, was going to take up her abode in the body of Avice Caro. It was difficult to meet her again, even though on this lump of rock the difficulty lay as a rule rather in avoidance than in meeting. But Avice had been transformed into a very different kind of young woman by the self-consciousness engendered of her impulsive greeting, and, notwithstanding their near neighbourhood, he could not encounter her, try as he would. No sooner did he appear an inch beyond his father’s door than she was to earth like a fox; she bolted upstairs to her room. Anxious to soothe her after his unintentional slight he could not stand these evasions long. The manners of the isle were primitive and straightforward, even among the well-to-do, and noting her disappearance one day he followed her into the house and onward to the foot of the stairs.'

const micemen = "A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a crushed Stetson hat under his arm while he combed his long, black, damp hair straight back. Like the others he wore blue jeans and a short denim jacket. When he had finished combing his hair he moved into the room, and he moved with a majesty achieved only by royalty and master craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince of the ranch, capable of driving ten, sixteen, even twenty mules with a single line to the leaders. He was capable of killing a fly on the wheeler's butt with a bull whip without touching the mule. There was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love. This was Slim, the jerkline skinner. His hatchet face was ageless. He might have been thirty-five or fifty. His ear heard more than was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought. His hands, large and lean, were as delicate in their action as those of a temple dancer.  He smoothed out his crushed hat, creased it in the middle and put it on. He looked kindly at the two in the bunkhouse. It's brighter'n a bitch outside, he said gently. Can't hardly see nothing in here. You the new guys?'Slim sat down on a box across the table from George. He studied the solitaire hand that was upside down to him. Hope you get on my team, he said. His voice was very gentle. I gotta pair of punks on my team that don't know a barley bag from a blue ball. You guys ever bucked any barley? Hell, yes, said George. I ain't nothing to scream about, but that big bastard there can put up more grain alone than most pairs can. Lennie, who had been following the conversation back and forth with his eyes, smiled complacently at the compliment. Slim looked approvingly at George for having given the compliment. He leaned over the table and snapped the corner of a loose card. You guys travel around together? His tone was friendly. It invited confidence without demanding it. Sure, said George. We kinda look after each other. He indicated Lennie with his thumb. He ain't bright. Hell of a good worker, though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain't bright. I've knew him for a long time. Slim looked through George and beyond him. Ain't many guys travel around together, he mused. I don't know why. Maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.  It's a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know, said George. A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunkhouse. His head still dripped water from the scrubbing and dousing. Hi, Slim, he said, and then stopped and stared at George and Lennie."

const micemen2 = "Guess you're right,' said Slim. 'Got it right in the book.' George held out his hand for the magazine. 'Let's look at it?' Whit found the place again, but he did not surrender his hold on it. He pointed out the letter with his forefinger. And then he went to his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in. 'I wonder if Bill seen it,' he said. 'Bill and me worked in that patch of field peas. Run cultivators, both of us. Bill was a hell of a nice fella.' During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him uneasily. At last Carlson said, 'If you want me to, I'll put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without hurtin'.' Candy said hopefully, 'You ain't got no gun.' 'The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all.' Candy said, 'Maybe tomorra. Le's wait till tomorra.''I don't see no reason for it,' said Carlson. He went to his bunk, pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. 'Let's get it over with,' he said. 'We can't sleep with him stinkin' around in here.' He put the pistol in his hip pocket. Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, 'Awright- take 'im.' He did not look down at the dog at all. He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling. From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped over and tied it around the old dog's neck. All the men except Candy watched him. 'Come boy. Come on, boy,' he said gently. And he said apologetically to Candy, 'He won't even feel it.' Candy did not move nor answer him. He twitched the thong. 'Come on, boy.' The old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash. Slim said, 'Carlson.' "

const micemen3 = "George asked casually, 'Been any trouble since she got here?'It was obvious that Whit was not interested in his cards. He laid his hand down and George scooped it in. George laid out his deliberate solitaire hand- seven cards, and six on top, and five on top of those. Whit said, 'I see what you mean. No, they ain't been nothing yet Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' time the guys is around she shows up.

An' Curley's pants is just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet.' George said, 'She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley got his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it ain't no place for a girl, specially like her.' Whit said, 'If you got idears, you oughtta come in town with us guys tomorra night.' 'Why? What's doin'?' 'Jus' the usual thing. We go in to old Susy's place. Hell of a nice place. Old Susy's a laugh- always crackin' jokes. Like she says when we come up on the front porch las' Sat'day night. Susy opens the door and then she yells over her shoulder, 'Get yor coats on, girls, here comes the sheriff.' She never talks dirty, neither. Got five girls there.' 'What's it set you back?' George asked. 'Two an' a half. You can get a shot for two bits. Susy got nice chairs to set in, too. If a guy don't want a flop, why he can just set in the chairs and have a couple or three shots and pass the time of day and Susy don't give a damn. She ain't rushin' guys through and kickin' 'em out if they don't want a flop.' 'Might go in and look the joint over,' said George. 'Sure. Come along. It's a hell of a lot of fun- her crackin' jokes all the time. Like she says one time, she says, 'I've knew people that if they got a rag rug on the floor an' a kewpie doll lamp on the phonograph they think they're running a parlor house.' That's Clara's house she's talkin' about. An' Susy says, 'I know what you boys want,' she says. 'My girls is clean,' she says, 'an' there ain't no water in my whisky,' she says. 'If any you guys wanta look at a kewpie doll lamp an' take your own chance gettin' burned, why you know where to go.' An' she says, 'There's guys around here walkin' bow-legged 'cause they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp.'' George asked, 'Clara runs the other house, huh?' 'Yeah,' said Whit. 'We don't never go there. Clara gets three bucks a crack and thirty-five cents a shot, and she don't crack no jokes. But Susy's place is clean and she got nice chairs. Don't let no goo-goos in, neither.' 'Me an' Lennie's rollin' up a stake,' said George. 'I might go in an' set and have a shot, but I ain't puttin' out no two and a half.' 'Well, a guy got to have some fun sometime,' said Whit. The door opened and Lennie and Carlson came in together. Lennie crept to his bunk and sat down, trying not to attract attention. Carlson reached under his bunk and brought out his bag. He didn't look at old Candy, who still faced the wall. Carlson found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil. He laid them on his bed and then brought out the pistol, took out the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber. Then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the little rod. When the ejector snapped, Candy turned over and looked for a moment at the gun before he turned back to the wall again."

const night = "Books no longer have the power they once did. Those who kept silent yesterday will remain silent tomorrow. THE READER would be entitled to ask: Why this new translation, since the earlier one has been around for forty-five years? If it is not faithful or not good enough, why did I wait so long to replace it with one better and closer to the original? In response, I would say only that back then, I was an unknown writer who was just getting started. My English was far from good. When my British publisher told me that he had found a translator, I was pleased. I later read the translation and it seemed all right. I never reread it. Since then, many of my other works have been translated by Marion, my wife, who knows my voice and how to transmit it better than anyone else. I am fortunate: when Farrar, Straus and Giroux asked her to prepare a new translation, she accepted. I am convinced that the readers will appreciate her work. In fact, as a result of her rigorous editing, I was able to correct and revise a number of important details. And so, as I reread this text written so long ago, I am glad that I did not wait any longer. And yet, I still wonder: Have I used the right words? I speak of my first night over there. The discovery of the reality inside the barbed wire. The warnings of a 'veteran' inmate, counseling my father and myself to lie about our ages: my father was to make himself younger, and I older. The selection. The march toward the chimneys looming in the distance under an indifferent sky. The infants thrown into fiery d i t c h e s… I did not say that they were alive, but that was what I thought. But then I convinced myself: no, they were dead, otherwise I surely would have lost my mind. And yet fellow inmates also saw them; they were alive when they were thrown into the flames. Historians, among them Telford Taylor, confirmed it. And yet somehow I did not lose my mind."

const boxcarchildren =  "Henry did not stop to ask questions. He picked up Benny, telling Violet to gather up the hay. And then they ran headlong through the thick underbrush in Jess' wake, seeing their way only too well by the sharp flashes of lightning.  'It's beginning to sprinkle!' gasped Henry.  'We'll get there, all right,' Jess shouted back. 'It's not far. Be all ready to help me open the door when we get there!'  By sheer good fortune a big tree stump stood under the door of the freight car, or the children never could have opened it. As it was, Jess sprang on the stump and Henry, pausing to lay Benny down, did likewise. Together they rolled back the heavy door about a foot.  'That's enough,' panted Jess. 'I'll get in, and you hand Benny up to me.'  'No,' said Henry quietly. 'I must see first if any one is in there.'  'It will rain!' protested Jess. 'Nothing will hurt me.'  But she knew it was useless to argue with Henry, so she hastily groped in the bag for the matches and handed them to her brother. It must be confessed that Jess held her breath while Henry struck one and peered about inside the car.  'All's well!' he reported. 'Come in, everybody!'  Violet passed the hay up to her brother, and crawled in herself. Then Jess handed Benny up like a package of groceries and, taking one last look at the angry sky and waving trees, she climbed in after him.  The two children managed to roll the door back so that the crack was completely closed before the storm broke. But at that very instant it broke with a vengeance. It seemed to the children that the sky would split, so sharp were the cracks of thunder. But not a drop of rain reached them in their roomy retreat. They could see nothing at all, for the freight car was tightly made, and all outside was nearly as black as night. Through it all, Benny slept on.  Presently the thunder grew fainter, and rumbled away down the valley, and the rain spent itself. Only the drip from the trees on the top of the car could be heard. Then Henry ventured to open the door.  He knelt on his hands and knees and thrust his head out.  The warm sunlight was filtering through the trees, making golden pools of light here and there. The beautiful trees, pines and white birches and oaks, grew thickly around and the ground was carpeted with flowers and wonderful ferns more than a yard high. But most miraculous of all was a miniature waterfall, small but perfect, where the same little brown brook fell gracefully over some ledges, and danced away down the glen.  In an instant Jess and Violet were looking over Henry's shoulder at the pretty sight.  'How different everything looks with the sun shining!' exclaimed Jess. 'Things will soon be dry at this rate.'  'It must be about noon,' observed Henry, looking at the sun. And as he spoke the faint echo of mill bells in the distance was heard.  'Henry!' said Jess sharply. 'Let's _live_ here!'  'Live here?' repeated Henry dully.  'Yes! Why not?' replied Jess. 'Nobody uses this car, and it's dry and warm. We're quite far away. And yet we are near enough to a town so we can buy things.'  'And we're near water,' added Violet.  Jess hugged her sister. 'So we are, little mouse,' she said--'the most important thing of all.'  'But--' began Henry.  '_Please_, Henry,' said Jess excitedly. 'I could make this old freight car into the dearest little house, with beds, and chairs, and a table--and dishes--'  'I'd like to live here, too,' said a determined little voice from the corner, 'but I don't want to, unless--'  'Unless what?' asked Henry, panic-stricken.  'Unless I can have my dinner,' Benny finished anxiously.  'We'll have something to eat right away, old fellow,' said Henry, thankful it was no worse. For he himself was beginning to see what a cozy home the car really would make.  Jess cut the last loaf of bread into four pieces, but alas! it was very dry. The children were so hungry that they tore it with their teeth like little dogs, but Benny was nearly crying. He did not actually cry, however, for just at the crucial moment Violet started a funny story about Cinnamon Bear eating bread crusts out of the ash can.  'He ought to have milk,' said Jess quietly to Henry.  'He _shall_ have milk,' replied Henry. 'I'll go down the railroad track to the town and get some.'  Jess counted out a dollar in ten dimes and handed it to Henry. 'By the time our four dollars are gone, you will have some work to do,' she said.  All the same Henry did not like to begin his trip. 'How I hate to leave you alone, Jess!' he said miserably.  'Oh, don't you worry,' began Jess lightly. 'We'll have a surprise for you when you come back. You just wait and see!' And she nodded her head wisely as Henry walked slowly off through the woods.  The moment he was out of sight she turned to Benny and Violet. 'Now, children,' she said, 'what do you think we're going to do? Do you know what I saw over in the sunny part of the woods? I saw some blueberries!'  'Oh, oh!' cried Benny, who knew what blueberries were. 'Can't we have some blueberries and milk?'  'We certainly--' began Jess. But the sentence never was finished, for a sharp crackle of dry leaves was heard. Something was moving in the woods.     A NEW HOME   'Keep still!' whispered Jess.  Benny obeyed. The three children were as motionless as stone images, huddled inside the freight car. Jess opened her mouth in order to breathe at all, her heart was thumping so wildly. She watched like a cat through the open door, in the direction of the rustling noise. And in a moment the trembling bushes parted, and out crawled a dog. He was an Airedale and was pulling himself along on three legs, whimpering softly.  Jess drew a long breath of relief, and said to the children, 'It's all right. Only a dog. But he seems to be hurt.'  At the sound of her voice the dog lifted his eyes and wagged his tail feebly. He held up his front foot.  'Poor doggie,' murmured Jess soothingly, as she clambered out of the car. 'Let Jess see your poor lame foot.' She approached the dog carefully, for she remembered that her mother had always told her never to touch a strange dog unless he wagged his tail.  But this dog's tail was wagging, certainly, so Jess bent over without fear to look at the paw. An exclamation of pity escaped her when she saw it, for a stiff, sharp thorn had been driven completely through one of the cushions of the dog's foot, and around it the blood had dried.  'I guess I can fix that,' said Jess briskly. 'But taking the thorn out is going to hurt you, old fellow.'  The dog looked up at her as she laid his paw down, and licked her hand.  'Come here, Violet and Benny,' directed Jess.  She took the animal gently in her lap and turned him on his side. She patted his head and stroked his nose with one finger, and offered him the rest of her breadcrust, which she had put in her apron pocket. The dog snapped it up as if he were nearly starved. Then she held the soft paw firmly with her left hand, and pulled steadily on the thorn with her right hand. The dog did not utter a sound. He lay motionless in her lap, until the thorn suddenly let go and lay in Jess' hand.  'Good, good!' cried Violet.  'Wet my handkerchief,' Jess ordered briskly.  Violet did so, dipping it in the running brook. Jess wrapped the cool, wet folds around the hot paw, and gently squeezed it against the wound, the dog meanwhile trying to lick her hands.  'We'll s'prise Henry, won't we?' laughed Benny delightedly. 'Now we got a dog!'  'To be sure,' said Jess, struck with the thought, 'but that isn't what I intended for a surprise. You know I was intending to get a lot of blueberries, and maybe find some old dishes in a dump or something--'  'Can't we look while you hold the dog?' asked Violet anxiously.  'Of course you can, Pet!' said Jess. 'Look over there by those rocks.'  Benny and Violet scrambled through the underbrush to the place Jess pointed out, and investigated. But they did not hunt long, for the blueberries were so thick that the bushes almost bent over with their weight.  'O Jessy,' screamed Benny, 'you never saw so many in your life! What'll we pick 'em into?'  'Come and get a clean towel,' said Jess, who noticed that Benny was already 'picking into' his own mouth.  'But that's just as well,' she thought. 'Because he won't get so hungry waiting for the milk.' She watched the two children a moment as they dropped handfuls of the bluish globes on the towel. Then she carefully got up with her little patient and went over and sat down in the center of the patch. The berries were so thick she did not have to change her position before the towel held over a quart.  'Oh, dear,' sighed Jess. 'I wish I could hunt for some dishes, so we could have blueberries and milk.'  'Never mind tonight,' said Violet. 'We can just eat a handful of berries and then take a drink of milk, when Henry comes.'  But it was even better than that, for when Henry came he had two bottles of milk under one arm, a huge loaf of brown bread under the other, and some golden cheese in waxed paper in his pocket.  But you should have seen Henry stare when he saw what Jess was holding!  'Where in the world--' began the boy.  'He _camed_ to us,' volunteered Benny. 'He camed for a s'prise for you. And he's a nice doggie.'  Henry knelt down to look at the visitor, who wagged his tail. 'It wouldn't be a bad thing to have a watchdog,' said Henry. 'I worried about you all the time I was gone.'  'Did you bring some milk?' inquired Benny, trying to be polite, but looking at the bottles with longing eyes."

My spots fly here. My spots fly there. I call them back, now, One! Two! Three! Now all my spots are back with me. Tell me. Tell me, now you two. Do you like the things I do? Tell me. Tell me, now, you two. Will they put me in the zoo? We like all the things you do. We like your spots, we like you, too. But you should not be in the zoo. No. You should NOT be in the zoo. With all the things that you can do, the circus is the place for you! Yes! This is where I want to be. The circus is the place for me! Some days are yellow. Some are blue. On different days Im different too. Youd be surprised how many ways I change on different colored days. On Bright Red Days how good it feels to be a horse and kick my heels! On other days Im other things. On Bright Blue Days I flap my wings. Some days, of course, feel sort of Brown. then I feel slow and low, low down. Then comes a Yellow Day. And wheeee I am a busy, buzzy bee. Gray Day... Everything is gray. I watch. But nothing moves today. Then all of a sudden Im a circus seal! On my Orange Days thats how I feel. Green Days. Deep deep in the sea. Cool and quiet fish. Thats me. On Purple Days Im sad. I groan. I drag my tail. I walk alone. But when my days are Happy Pink its great to jump and just not think. Then come my black days. Mad. And loud. I howl. I growl at every cloud. Then comes a Mixed-Up Day. And WHAM! I dont know who or what I am! But it all turns out all right, you see.'

const junieb1 = 'My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except I don’t like Beatrice. I just like B and that’s all. I’m almost six years old. Almost six is when you get to go to kindergarten. Kindergarten is where you go to meet new friends and not watch TV. My kindergarten is the afternoon kind. Today was my first day of school. I’d been to my room before, though. Last week Mother took me there to meet my teacher. It was called Meet the Teacher Day. My teacher was decorating the bulletin board with the letters of the alphabet. I already know all of those letters, I said. I can sing them. Except I don’t feel like it right now. My teacher shook my hand. Only our hands didn’t fit together that good. Her name was Mrs.— I can’t remember the rest of it. Mrs. said I looked cute. I know it, I said. That’s because I have on my new shoes. I held my foot way high in the air. See how shiny they are? Before I put them on, I licked them. And guess what else? I said. This is my bestest hat. Grampa Miller bought it for me. See the devil horns sticking out the sides? Mrs. laughed. Except I don’t know why. Devil horns are supposed to be scary. Then we walked around the room and she showed me where stuff was. Like the easels where we get to paint. And the shelves where the books are. And the tables where we sit and don’t watch TV. One of the tables in the front of the room had a red chair. I would like to sit here, I think, I told her. But Mrs. said, We’ll have to wait and see, Junie. B! I said. Call me Junie B.! I hollered the B part real loud. So she wouldn’t forget it. People are always forgetting my B. Mother rolled her eyes and looked at the ceiling. I looked up there, too. But I didn’t see anything. Are you going to ride the bus, Junie B.? Mrs. asked me. I made my shoulders go up and down, I don’t know. Where’s it goin’ to? My mother nodded her head and said, Yes, she’ll be riding the bus. That made me feel scary inside. ’Cause I never rided on a bus before. Yeah, only where’s it goin’ to? I asked again. Mrs. sat on her desk. Then she and my mother talked more about the bus. I tapped on Mrs. Guess what? I still don’t know where it’s goin’ to. Mrs. smiled and said the bus driver’s name was Mr. Woo. Mr. Woo, said Mother. That’s an easy name for Junie B. to remember. I covered my ears and stamped my foot. YEAH, ONLY WHERE’S THE STUPID SMELLY BUS GOIN’ TO? Mother and Mrs. frowned. Frowning is when your eyebrows look grumpy. Watch yourself, missy, said Mother. Missy’s my name when I’m in trouble. I looked down at my shoes. They didn’t look as shiny as they did before. Just then another mother and a boy came in. And Mrs. went off to talk to them instead of me. I don’t know why, though. The boy was hiding behind his mother and acting very babyish. I can beat that boy up, I think. After that, my mother sat me down and explained about the bus. She said it’s yellow. And it’s called a school bus. And it stops at the end of my street. Then I get on it. And sit down. And it takes me to school. And then your teacher will meet you in the parking lot, said Mother. Okay, Junie B.? Won’t that be fun? I nodded the word yes. But inside my head I said the word no.I stayed scared about the bus for a whole week. And last night when my mother tucked me into bed, I still felt sickish about it. Guess what? I said. I don’t think I want to ride that school bus to kindergarten tomorrow. Then my mother rumpled my hair. Oh, sure you do, she said. Oh, sure I don’t, I said back. Then Mother kissed me and said, It’ll be fun. You’ll see. Just don’t worry. I did, though. I worried very much. And I didn’t sleep so good, either. And this morning I felt very droopy when I got up. And my stomach was squeezy. And I couldn’t eat my cereal. And so I watched TV until Mother said it was time to get ready to go. Then I put on my skirt that looks like velvet. And my new fuzzy pink sweater. And I ate half a tuna sandwich for lunch. After that, Mother and I walked to the corner to wait for the bus. And guess what? There was another mother and little girl there, too. The little girl had curly black hair—which is my favorite kind of head. I didn’t say hello to her, though. ’Cause she was from a different street, that’s why. Then finally this big yellow bus came around the corner. And the brakes screeched very loud. And I had to cover my ears. Then the door opened. And the bus driver said, Hi! I’m Mr. Woo. Hop on! Except I didn’t hop on. ’Cause my legs didn’t want to. I don’t think I want to ride this bus to kindergarten, I told Mother again. Then she gave me a little push. Go on, Junie B., she said. Mr. Woo is waiting for you. Be a big girl and get on. I looked up at the windows. The little girl with the curly black hair was already in the bus. She looked very big sitting up there. And kind of happy. Look how big that little girl is acting, Junie B., said Mother. Why don’t you sit right next to her? It’ll be fun. I promise. And so I got on the bus. And guess what? It wasn’t fun.The bus wasn’t like my daddy’s car at all. It was very big inside. And the seats didn’t have any cloth on them. The little curly girl was sitting near the front. And so I tapped on her. Guess what? I said. Mother said for me to sit here. No! she said. I’m saving this seat for my best friend, Mary Ruth Marble! Then she put her little white purse on the place where I was going to sit. And so I made a face at her. Hurry up and find a seat, young lady, said Mr. Woo. And so I quick sat down across from the curly mean girl. And Mr. Woo shut the door. It wasn’t a regular kind of door, though. It folded in half. And when it closed, it made a whishy sound. I don’t like that kind of door. If it closes on you by accident, it will cut you in half, and you will make a squishy sound. The bus made a big roar. Then a big puff of black smelly smoke came out the bade end of it. It’s called bus breath, I think. Mr. Woo drove for a while. Then the brakes made that loud, screechy noise again. I covered my ears so it couldn’t get inside my head. ’Cause if loud, screechy noises get inside your head, you have to take an aspirin. I saw that on a TV commercial. Then the bus door opened again. And a dad and a boy with a grouchy face got on. The dad smiled. Then he plopped the grouchy boy right next to me. This is Jim, he said. I’m afraid Jim isn’t too happy this afternoon. The dad kissed the boy good-bye. But the boy wiped it off his cheek. Jim had on a backpack. It was blue. I love backpacks. I wish I had one of my very own. One time I found a red one in a trash can. But it had a little bit of gushy on it, and Mother said no. Jim’s backpack had lots of zippers. I touched each one of them. One…two…three…four, I counted. Then I unzipped one. HEY! DON’T! yelled Jim. He zipped it right up again. Then he moved to the seat in front of me. I hate that Jim. After that, the bus kept stopping and starting. And lots of kids kept getting on. Loud kids. And some of them were the kind who look like meanies. Then the bus began getting very noisy and hot inside. And the sun kept shining down on me and my fuzzy hot sweater. And here’s another hot thing. I couldn’t roll down my window because it didn’t have a handle. And so I just kept on getting hotter and hotter. And it smelled in the bus, too. The bus smelled like an egg salad sandwich. I want to get off of here, I said right out loud. But nobody heard me. I hate it in this stupid smelly bus. Then my eyes got a little bit wet. I wasn’t crying, though. ’Cause I’m not a baby, that’s why. After that, my nose started running. Only the bus didn’t have a glove compartment. Which is where you keep the travel tissues, of course. And so I had to wipe my nose on my fuzzy pink sweater sleeve. Then I stayed on the bus for about an hour or three. Until finally I saw a flagpole and a playground. That meant we were at kindergarten! Then Mr. Woo drove the bus into the parking lot and stopped. I jumped up very fast. ’Cause all I wanted to do was get off that stupid smelly thing! Only guess what? That Jim pushed right in front of me. And the curly mean girl did, too. And then people started squishing me real tight. And so I pushed them away. And they pushed me right back. That’s when I fell down! And a big foot stepped on my skirt that looks like velvet. STOP IT! I yelled. Then Mr. Woo hollered, HEY, HEY, HEY! And he picked me up. And helped me off the bus. Mrs. was waiting for me just like my mother said. Hi! I’m glad to see you! she called. Then I ran over to her. And I showed her the big footprint on my skirt that looks like velvet. Yeah, only look what happened. I got stepped on and so now I’m soiled. Mrs. brushed it. Don’t worry, Junie, she said. It’ll come off. After that I just folded my arms and made a frown. ’Cause guess what? She forgot my B again. 4/Me and Lucille and Some Other Kids Some of the other bus kids turned out to be in my class, too. One of them was that Jim. That Jim I hate. Mrs. made us line up. Then we followed her to our room. Its name is Room Nine. There were other kids waiting by the door. When Mrs. unlocked it, everyone squeezed in all at once. That Jim stepped on my new shoe. He made a scratch mark on my shiny toe. The kind of scratch that licking won’t fix. HEY! WATCH IT, YOU DUMB JIM! I hollered at him. Mrs. bent down next to me. Let’s try to use our quiet voice while we’re in school, she said. I nodded nicely. I hate that Jim, I said in my quiet voice. After that, Mrs. clapped her hands together very loud. I want everyone to find a chair and sit down as fast as you can, she said. That’s when I ran to the table with the red chair. Only guess what? There was already someone sitting there! A girl with little red fingernails. And so I tapped on her and said, I would like to sit there, I think. No, she said. I am. Yeah, only I already picked that chair out, I told her. Ask my mother if you don’t believe me. But the girl just shook her head no. And then Mrs. clapped her loud hands again and said, Please find a seat! And so then I had to quick sit down in a stupid yellow chair. The same stupid color as the stupid yellow bus. After that, Mrs. walked to a big closet in the back of the room. It’s called the supply closet. She got out boxes of new pointy crayons and some white circles. Then she passed them out. And we had to print our names on the circles and pin them to our fronts. It was our first work. If you need help spelling your name, raise your hand, said Mrs. I raised my hand. I don’t need help, I told her. Grandma Miller says I print beautifully. I used red. But then a mistake happened. I made my JUNIE too big and there wasn’t any room left for my B. And so I had to squish it very teeny at the bottom. I HATE THIS STUPID DUMB CIRCLE! I hollered. Mrs. made the shhh sound and gave me a new one. Thank you, I said nicely. Grandma Miller says I print beautifully. The girl with the little red fingernails was faster than me. She showed me her circle and pointed to her letters. L-U-C-I-L-L-E. That spells Lucille, she said. I like that name of Lucille, I said. ’Cause guess why? Seals are my favorite animals. That’s why. Then Mrs. passed out drawing paper. And we drew pictures of our family. Mrs. put a happy-face sticker on mine. It was very good. Except I made my father too teeny. And Mother’s hair looked like sticks. After that, Mrs. took our class on a walk around the school. Everyone had to find a buddy to walk with. My buddy was Lucille. We held hands. The boy I can beat up was right in front of us. His buddy was that Jim. That Jim I hate. The first place we walked to is called the Media Center. My mother calls it a library. It’s where the books are. And guess what? Books are my very favorite things in the whole world! HEY! THERE’S A JILLION OF THEM IN HERE! I hollered, feeling very excited. I THINK I LOVE THIS PLACE! The librarian bent down next to me. She said to use my quiet voice. YEAH, ONLY GUESS WHAT? RIGHT NOW I JUST LIKE THE KIND OF BOOKS WITH PICTURES. BUT MOTHER SAYS WHEN I GET BIG, I’M GOING TO LIKE THE KIND WITH JUST WORDS. AND ALSO, STEWED TOMATOES. The boy I can beat up said, Shhh. I made a fist at him. Then he turned around. After that, we went to the cafeteria. The cafeteria is where kids eat lunch. Except not when you’re in kindergarten. Ummm! I said. It smells yummy in here! Just like pasketti and meatballs! Then that Jim turned around and held his nose. P.U.…I smell you, he said. Lucille laughed very hard. And so I stopped holding her hand. The next place we went to was the nurse’s office. It’s very cute in that place. There are two little beds where you get to lie down. And two little blankets that are the color of plaid. Our nurse doesn’t look like a nurse. She doesn’t wear white clothes and white shoes. Our nurse is just a regular color. Lucille raised her hand. My brother said that last year he came here. And you let him take off his shoes. And he got a drink of water in just his socks! That Jim turned around again. P.U.…I smell your feet, he said to Lucille. This time Lucille stuck out her tongue at him. After that, we held hands again.'

const junieb2 = 'After that, we walked to the water fountain. And Mrs. let us get a drink. I didn’t get a long one, though. ’Cause kids kept tapping on me. Hurry up, girl, they said. Yeah, only guess what? That’s not even my name, I told them. Her name is Junie Bumblebee, said Lucille. Then she laughed. But I didn’t think it was a very funny joke. After that, Mrs. showed us where the bathrooms were. There’s two kinds of bathrooms in our school. A boys’ kind. And a girls’ kind. I can’t go in the boys’ kind, though. ’Cause no girls allowed, that’s why. I tried to peek my head in there. But Mrs. snapped her fingers at me. The only boy who got to go into the bathroom was the boy I can beat up. He was jiggling around very much. Then he started running all over the place. And he was holding the front of his pants. William! said Mrs. Are you having an emergency? Then William yelled, YES! And he ran right in there. The rest of us walked back to our room. I touched Lucille’s fingernails. She said that her fingernail polish is named Very Very Berry. I would like to have my fingernails red, too, I said. But I’m only allowed to have the kind of polish that makes them look shiny. Its name is Clear. Clear is the color of spit. I hate Clear, said Lucille. Me too, I told her. And also I hate yellow—which is the color of the stupid smelly school bus. Lucille nodded her head. My brother said when you ride home on the bus, kids pour chocolate milk on your head. Then all of a sudden my stomach felt very squeezy again. ’Cause I had to ride the bus home, that’s why. Why did you have to tell me that for, Lucille? I said kind of grouchy. After we got back to Room Nine, we did some more work. It was a game to help us learn each other’s names. I learned Lucille. And also a girl named Charlotte. And another girl named Grace. Then I learned a boy named Ham—which we eat at Grandma Miller’s. Pretty soon Mrs. clapped her loud hands together. Okay, everyone. Gather up your things. It’s almost time for the bell. Then I heard a noise in the parking lot. It was screechy brakes. And so I looked out the window. And I saw the school bus. It was coming to get me! Oh no! I said kind of loud. Now I’m going to get chocolate milk poured on my head! Then I chewed on my fingers. Get in line! Get in line! said Mrs. When we get outside, I want all of my bus students to come with me. The rest of you must go to the crossing guard. Everyone was lining up. I was the very last one. Just then the bell rang and Mrs. marched out the door. Then everybody else marched out, too. Except guess what? I didn’t. 6/A Good Hider When you’re the very last one in line, nobody watches you. That’s how come nobody saw me when I ducked behind the teacher’s desk and hid. I’m a good hider. One time at Grandma Miller’s house, I hid under the kitchen sink. Then I made a growly sound and sprung out at her. I’m not allowed to do that anymore. Anyway, I stayed scrunched behind the teacher’s desk for a while. And then I saw a better place to hide. It was the big supply closet in the back of the room. And so I ran back there very fast. And I squeezed onto the bottom shelf. I squeezed right on top of the construction paper. Most of me was comfortable. Except my head was sort of very tight. And my knees were all bended. Like when I do a somersault. Then I pulled the door mostly closed. Don’t shut it all the way, though. And I mean it, I said right out loud. I stayed real quiet for lots of minutes. Then I heard noises in the hall. And some feet came running into the room. Big people’s feet, I think. What happened? I heard someone ask. One of my little girls is lost, said a voice that sounded like Mrs. Her name is Junie B. Jones. And she didn’t get on the bus. So now we’ve got to go out looking for her. Then I heard some keys jingle. And the feet went running out again. And men the door shut. I still didn’t come out of the closet, though. When you’re a good hider, you can’t come out for a very, very long time. I just stayed mere all bended up. And I told myself a story. Not an out-loud story. I just told it inside my head. It was called The Little Hiding Girl. I made it up. And this is how it went: Once upon a time there was a little hiding girl. She was in a secret spot where nobody could find her. Except her head was very tight. And her brain was squishing out. But she still couldn’t come out of her spot. Or a smelly yellow monster would get her. And also, some meanies with chocolate milk. The end. After that, I rested my eyes. Resting your eyes is what my grampa does when he watches TV after dinner. Then he snores. And Grandma Miller says, Go to bed, Frank. It’s not the same thing as a nap, though. ’Cause naps are for babies, that’s why. And anyway, I didn’t snore. I just did a little drool. Then finally when my eyes were done resting, they woke up. And so I came out of the closet and ran right to the window. And guess what? There weren’t any cars in the parking lot. And no stupid smelly bus, either! Whew! That’s a relief, I said. A relief is when your stomach doesn’t feel squeezy anymore. After that, I went back to the closet. ’Cause while I was hiding, I sniffed the smell of clay, that’s why. And clay is my very favorite thing in the whole world! Hey! I see it up there! I said. The clay was on the middle shelf. I stood on a chair to get it. It was blue and stiff. And so I had to roll it on the floor to make it soft and warm. Then I rolled it into a blue orange. It was very beautiful. Except it had some dirt and hair on it. After I was done, I went to the front of the room and sat down in my teacher’s big chair. I like teachers’ desks very much. The drawers are so big I could fit in one, I think. I opened up the top one. There were happy-face stickers. And rubber bands. And also, gold stars—which I love a very lot. I stuck one on my forehead. Then I found paper clips. And red marking pens. And new pencils with no points. And scissors. And travel tissues. And guess what else? Chalk! I said. Brand-new chalk that’s not even out of its little box yet! Then I stood up on my teacher’s chair and clapped my hands together very loud. I want everyone to find a chair and sit down! Today we are going to learn some alphabet and some reading. And also, I will teach you how to make a blue orange. But first, everyone has to watch me draw stuff. Then I went to the board and drew with my brand-new chalk. I drew a bean and a carrot and some curly hair. Then I wrote some O’s. O’s are my bestest letter. After that, I bowed. Thank you very much, I said. Now you may all go out for recess… I smiled. Except for not that Jim. 7/Peeky Holes and Spying After a while, I started to get a little bit thirsty. That’s what happens when chalk sprinkles get in your throat. I would like a drink of water, I think, I said. Then I put my hands on my hips. Yeah, only what if somebody sees you at the water fountain? Then they might call the stupid smelly bus to come get you. And so you better not go. I stamped my foot. Yeah, only I have to go! ’Cause there’s dumb chalk in my throat! Then all of a sudden I got a great idea! I pulled a chair over to the door. And I peeked out the window at the top! I’m a good peeker. One time I peeked right into Grampa Miller’s mouth when he was sleeping. And I saw that dangly thing that hangs down in the back. I didn’t touch it, though. ’Cause I didn’t have a little stick or anything, that’s why. Anyway, I didn’t see anybody in the hall. And so I opened the door a crack. And I sniffed. ’Cause when you sniff, you can smell if there’s people around. I learned sniffing from my dog, Tickle. Dogs can smell everything. People can mostly just smell big smells. Like stink and flowers and dinner. Nope. Don’t smell anyone, I said. Then I ran to the water fountain and I drank for a long time. And nobody tapped on me and said, Hurry up, girl. After that, I stood on my tippy-toes. And I tippy-toed to the Media Center. ’Cause I love that place! Remember? The Media Center is kind of like a fort. The shelves are like walls. And the books are sort of like bricks. And you can move some of them around and make peeky holes. Peeky holes are what you spy out of. Then if you see somebody coming, you can make your breath very quiet. And they won’t find you. I spied for a long time. But nobody came. The only people in the Media Center were just me and some fish. The fish were in a big glass tank. I waved at them in there. Then I stirred them with a pencil. I love fish very much. I eat them for dinner with coleslaw. Just then I saw my most favorite thing in the whole world! Its name is an electric pencil sharpener! And it was sitting right on the librarian’s desk! Hey! I said very excited. I think know how to work that thing! Then I looked in the desk drawer. And guess what? There were lots of brand-new pencils in there! And so I sharpened them! It was funner than anything! ’Cause an electric pencil sharpener makes a nice noise. And you can make pencils as teeny as you want. You just keep pushing them into the little hole. And they just keep on getting teenier and teenier. It doesn’t work on crayons, though. I tried a red one. Then the pencil sharpener slowed way down. And then it made a rrrrr-rrrrr sound. And after that, it didn’t go anymore. Just then I heard a noise! It was walking feet. And it made me scared inside. ’Cause I didn’t want anyone to find me, that’s why! And so I squatted way down and looked through my peeky hole. Then I saw a man with a trash can! He was singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow. That’s a song I know. It’s from my favorite movie, which is called The Wizard of Odds. The man with the can didn’t see me. He walked down the hall. Then I heard him go outside. I stayed squatted down for a long time. But he never came back. Whew! That was a close one! I said. And so then I ran to find a better place to hide. 8/The Dangerous Nurse’s Office Guess where I ran to? Straight to the nurse’s office, of course! ’Cause there’s those little plaid blankets to hide under! There’s other neat stuff in there, too. Like a scale to weigh yourself. And a sign with a giant E and other letters. The nurse uses the sign to test your eyes. She points to the letters. And you have to yell out their names. You have to yell the E the loudest. That’s how come it’s so big. And guess what else I saw in the nurse’s office? Band-Aids, that’s what! I love those guys! They were on top of the desk. And so I opened the lid. And I sniffed them. Ummm, I said. ’Cause Band-Aids smell just like a brand-new beach ball. Then I dumped them out. They were the most prettiest Band-Aids I ever saw! They were red and blue and green! And also yellow. Which is the color I hate. And they were different shapes, too. There were squares and circles. And some were that very long kind—which are called tangles, I think. I put a green circle on my knee. That’s where I fell down on the sidewalk last week. It’s mostly all better now. But if I press it very hard with my thumb, I can still make it hurt. After that, I put a blue tangle on my finger. That’s where I got a splinter from the picnic table. Mother pulled it out with tweezers. But there’s still some table in there, I think. Also, I put a red square on my arm. That’s where Tickle scratched me. Because I got him all wound up. Just then I saw the nurse’s purple sweater. It was hanging on her chair. I put it on. Now I’m the nurse, I said. Then I sat down. And I pretended to call the hospital. Hello, hospital? It’s me, the nurse. I need some more Band-Aids and some aspirins and some cherry cough drops. Only not the kind that make your mouth feel freezy. And I need some lollipops for when kids get needles. And also I need a little stick or something in case I have to touch that dangly thing that hangs down in your throat. Then I pretended to call Room Nine. Hello, Mrs.? Please send that Jim to my office. I have to give him a shot. Just then I saw my most favorite thing in the whole world! They were near the door. And their name is crutches! Crutches are for when you break a leg. Then the doctor puts it in a big white cast with just your piggies sticking out. And you can’t walk on it. And so she gives you crutches to swing yourself. I ran over and picked them up. Then I put them under my arms. Only they were way too long for me. And I didn’t swing that good. And so then I got another idea! I carried them to the nurse’s chair. And I climbed up there so I was real tall. And then I put the crutches under my arms. And they fitted just right! After that, I stood on the edge of the chair. And I leaned forward very slow. Except then a terrible thing happened! The chair was on wheels. And it rolled away from my feet! And I got stuck on the crutches way high in the air! And I was very dangly up there! HEY! I shouted. GET ME DOWN FROM HERE! Then I wiggled around. And one of the crutches slipped. And I came crashing down! And I banged my head on the desk! OW! I yelled. OW! OW! OW! Then I picked up the phone again. I quit this stupid job! I said. And then I ran out of there very fast. ’Cause the nurse’s office is a dangerous place. And crutches aren’t my favorite thing. 9/Zooming Speedy Fast I like running inside the school. It’s funner than running inside your house. In school you can zoom with your arms out like a jet plane. And you don’t knock over the furniture. And also the head doesn’t get broken off your mother’s bird statue. Which used to be a blue jay, I think. I zoomed straight to the cafeteria. ’Cause there’s a lot of tables to hide under in that place. Only when I tried to open the door, it was all locked up! And so then I ran to another room across the hall. Only that stupid door was locked, too! Hey! Who did all this dumb locking? I asked. Then I started jiggling up and down. ’Cause I was having a little bit of a problem, that’s why. The kind of problem that’s called personal. And it’s about going to the potty. And so all of a sudden I had to run down the hall speedy quick! Right to the girls’ bathroom! Only guess what? When I got there, that stupid door wouldn’t open, either! And so I kicked it. And I hanged on the handle. ’Cause I weigh thirty-seven. OPEN UP AND I MEAN IT! I yelled. But the door kept on staying shut! IT’S A ’MERGENCY! I shouted. And then all of a sudden I remembered about that boy I can beat up! ’Cause he had a ’mergeney, too! And he got to go into the boys’ bathroom! And so I zoomed across the hall. And I pulled on the boys’ bathroom door. But that dumb thing was locked, too! STUPID, STUPID DOORS! I hollered. After that, I started to jiggle up and down very fast. OH, NO! NOW I’M GONNA HAVE AN ACCIDENT ON MY SKIRT THAT LOOKS LIKE VELVET! Only just then I remembered something else about ’mergencies. ’Cause Mother told me what to do if I ever needed help. And its name is Call 911! And so then I ran back to the dangerous nurse’s office. ’Cause that’s where the phone was, of course! And then I picked it up. And I pushed the 9! And the 1! And another 1! HELP! THIS IS A ’MERGENCY! I yelled. ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED IN THIS PLACE! AND NOW I’M GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT! Then I heard a voice on the other end. She said for me to calm down. YEAH, ONLY I CAN’T! ’CAUSE I’M IN BIG TROUBLE! AND I’M ALL BY MYSELF! AND I NEED HELP REAL BAD! Then the lady said to calm down again. Except for I couldn’t stand still! And so I just hung up and ran right out of there. And I just kept running and running till I got to the big doors at the end of the hall. And then I runned right outside! ’Cause maybe there might be a little toilet out there or something. Except I didn’t see one. All I could hear was sirens! Loud sirens were all over the place. And they kept on getting closer and closer! And then a big green fire truck came zooming right around the corner! And a white police car! And a fast red ambulance! And guess what else? They turned right into the school parking lot! And so I stopped jiggling for a second. And I sniffed the air. Only I couldn’t smell any smoke! Then I heard a grouchy voice. HEY! HOLD IT, MISSY! it yelled. And I got very scared inside. ’Cause missy’s my name when I’m in trouble. I turned around. It was the man with the can! And he was running at me! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! he hollered again. And then I started to cry. Yeah, only that’s the trouble. I can’t hold it! I said. I already holded it all I can! And now I’m having a ’mergency! And all the bathrooms are locked! And now I’m going to have an accident very quick! And then the man with the can didn’t look so grouchy anymore. Well, why didn’t you say so, sis! he said. Then he pulled a big bunch of keys out of his pocket. And he grabbed my hand. And then him and me zoomed back into the school! Speedy fast! 10/Me and That Grace The man with the can unlocked the girls’ bathroom for me. And I ran right in there. And guess what? I made it! That’s what! I didn’t have an accident on my skirt that looks like velvet! Whew! That was a close one! I said. Then I washed my hands at the sink. And I looked in the mirror. And the gold star was still on my forehead! It looked very beautiful up there! After that, I went into the hall and the man with the can bended down to me. Everything okay, sis? he said. And so I nodded my head. I holded it, I said very happy. Then all of a sudden there were lots of people running at us. There were firemen. And policemen. And there was a tall lady rolling a bed on wheels. Hey! I said to the man with the can. What happened? Did somebody get runned over in here or something? Then I saw Mrs. and Principal and Mother. They were running at us, too. And then Mother bended down and hugged me very tight! After that everyone started talking at once. And nobody was using their quiet voices. And nobody was smiling either. Principal started asking me a jillion questions. Mostly they were questions about hiding in the supply closet. I’m a good hider, I told him. Principal acted a little bit grumpy. He said I wasn’t allowed to do that anymore. When you go to school, you have to follow the rules, he said. What would happen if every boy and girl hid in the supply closet after school? It would be very smushy in there, I said. Then he made his eyes frowny. But we wouldn’t know where anyone was, would we? he said. Yes, I said. We would all be in the supply closet. Then Principal looked up at the ceiling. And I looked up, too. But I didn’t see anything again. After that, Mother looked at my Band-Aids. Did you hurt yourself? she asked. And so I told her all about the dangerous nurse’s office. And then I showed her the nurse’s purple sweater. And she made me give it back. After that, everybody started leaving. The firemen. And the policemen. And also the tall lady with the bed. Then finally, my mother got to take me home. And guess what? I didn’t have to ride on the stupid smelly bus. Except the car wasn’t that fun. ’Cause Mother was grouchy at me. I’m sorry the bus wasn’t fun for you, Junie B., she said. But what you did was very, very wrong. Didn’t you see all the commotion you caused? You had a lot of people very scared. Yes, but I didn’t want chocolate milk poured on my head, I explained to her. That’s not going to happen, growled Mother. And you can’t just suddenly decide for yourself not to ride the bus. Hundreds of kids ride buses every day. And if they can do it, you can do it, too. Then my eyes got wet again. Yeah, but there’s meanies on that thing, I said all sniffly. Then Mother stopped being so growly. What if you had a friend to ride with? she said. Your teacher told me there’s a girl in your class who will be riding the bus for the first time tomorrow. Maybe you could sit together. Would you like that? I made my shoulders go up and down. Her name is Grace, said Mother. Grace? I said. Hey! I know that Grace! I learned her today! And so when we got home, Mother called that Grace’s mother. And then they talked. And then me and that Grace talked too. I said hi and she said hi. And she said she would sit with me. And so tomorrow I get to take my little red purse on the bus. And I get to put it on the seat next to me so nobody will sit there. Nobody except for that Grace, of course. And then she and me might get to be buddies. And we can hold hands. Just like me and Lucille. I will like that, I think. And guess what else? Tomorrow I think I might like yellow a little bit, too.'

const tessdurbervilles = 'On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor.  The pair of legs that carried him were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line.  He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything in particular.  An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune.  Good night tee, said the man with the basket.  Good night, Sir John, said the parson.  The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.  Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road about this time, and I said Good night, and you made reply _Good night, Sir John_, as now.  I did, said the parson.  And once before that--near a month ago.  I may have.  Then what might your meaning be in calling me Sir John these different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?  The parson rode a step or two nearer.  It was only my whim, he said; and, after a moments hesitation: It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history.  I am Parson Tringham, the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane.  Dont you really know, Durbeyfield, that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the dUrbervilles, who derive their descent from Sir Pagan dUrberville, that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?  Never heard it before, sir!  Well its true.  Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the profile of your face better.  Yes, thats the dUrberville nose and chin--a little debased.  Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire.  Branches of your family held manors over all this part of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen.  In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the Seconds time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there.  You declined a little in Oliver Cromwells time, but to no serious extent, and in Charles the Seconds reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty.  Aye, there have been generations of Sir Johns among you, and if knighthood were hereditary, like a baronetcy, as it practically was in old times, when men were knighted from father to son, you would be Sir John now.  Ye dont say so!  In short, concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his switch, theres hardly such another family in England.  Daze my eyes, and isnt there? said Durbeyfield.  And here have I been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish...  And how long hev this news about me been knowed, Pason Tringham?  The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all. His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the dUrberville family, he had observed Durbeyfields name on his waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject.  At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information," said he.  However, our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes.  I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while."  Well, I have heard once or twice, tis true, that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor.  But I took no notice ot, thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one.  Ive got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home, too; but, Lord, whats a spoon and seal? ...  And to think that I and these noble dUrbervilles were one flesh all the time. Twas said that my grt-granfer had secrets, and didnt care to talk of where he came from...  And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we dUrbervilles live?"  You dont live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family."  Thats bad."  Yes--what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line--that is, gone down--gone under."  Then where do we lie?"  At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies."  And where be our family mansions and estates?"  You havent any."  Oh?  No lands neither?"  None; though you once had em in abundance, as I said, for you family consisted of numerous branches.  In this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in Millpond, and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge."  And shall we ever come into our own again?"  Ah--that I cant tell!"  And what had I better do about it, sir?" asked Durbeyfield, after a pause.  Oh--nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of how are the mighty fallen.  It is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist, nothing more.  There are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre. Good night."  But youll turn back and have a quart of beer wi me on the strength ot, Pason Tringham?  Theres a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop--though, to be sure, not so good as at Rollivers."  No, thank you--not this evening, Durbeyfield.  Youve had enough already."  Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.  When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his basket before him.  In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield.  The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near.  Boy, take up that basket!  I want ee to go on an errand for me."  The lath-like stripling frowned.  Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me boy?  You know my name as well as I know yours!"  Do you, do you?  Thats the secret--thats the secret! Now obey my orders, and take the message Im going to charge ee wi...  Well, Fred, I dont mind telling you that the secret is that Im one of a noble race--it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, P.M."  And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies.  The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from crown to toe.  Sir John dUrberville--thats who I am," continued the prostrate man.  That is if knights were baronets--which they be.  Tis recorded in history all about me.  Dost know of such a place, lad, as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?"  Ees.  Ive been there to Greenhill Fair."  Well, under the church of that city there lie--"  Tisnt a city, the place I mean; leastwise twaddn when I was there--twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o place."  Never you mind the place, boy, thats not the question before us. Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors--hundreds of em--in coats of mail and jewels, in grt lead coffins weighing tons and tons.  Theres not a man in the county o South-Wessex thats got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I."  Oh?"  Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when youve come to The Pure Drop Inn, tell em to send a horse and carriage to me immedately, to carry me hwome.  And in the bottom o the carriage they be to put a noggin o rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my account.  And when youve done that goo on to my house with the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she neednt finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as Ive news to tell her."  As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he possessed.  Heres for your labour, lad."  This made a difference in the young mans estimate of the position.  Yes, Sir John.  Thank ee.  Anything else I can do for ee, Sir John?"  Tell em at hwome that I should like for supper,--well, lambs fry if they can get it; and if they cant, black-pot; and if they cant get that, well chitterlings will do."  Yes, Sir John."  The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village.  Whats that?" said Durbeyfield.  Not on account o I?"  Tis the womens club-walking, Sir John.  Why, your dater is one o the members."  To be sure--Id quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe Ill drive round and inspect the club."  The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun.  Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills.    II   The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape-painter, though within a four hours journey from London.  It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it--except perhaps during the droughts of summer.  An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways.  This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down.  The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through.  Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless.  Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.  The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine.  Arable lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major.  Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.  The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest. The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a curious legend of King Henry IIIs reign, in which the killing by a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine. In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely wooded.  Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its pastures.'

const tessd2 = 'Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: He called to see the doctor to-day in Shaston.  It is not consumption at all, it seems.  It is fat round his heart, a says.  There, it is like this.  Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer.  At the present moment, he says to your father, your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open, a says.  As soon as it do meet, so,--Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete--off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield, a says. You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.  Tess looked alarmed.  Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!  But where IS father? she asked again.  Her mother put on a deprecating look.  Now dont you be bursting out angry!  The poor man--he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pasons news--that he went up to Rollivers half an hour ago.  He do want to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load of beehives, which must be delivered, family or no.  Hell have to start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.  Get up his strength! said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her eyes.  O my God!  Go to a public-house to get up his strength! And you as well agreed as he, mother!  Her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart a cowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing about, and to her mothers face.  No, said the latter touchily, I be not agreed.  I have been waiting for ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him.  Ill go.  O no, Tess.  You see, it would be no use.  Tess did not expostulate.  She knew what her mothers objection meant.  Mrs Durbeyfields jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity.  And take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse, Joan continued, rapidly wiping her hands, and donning the garments.  The _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a table at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type.  Tess took it up, and her mother started.  This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of Mrs Durbeyfields still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children.  To discover him at Rollivers, to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval, made her happy.  A sort of halo, an occidental glow, came over life then.  Troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation, and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul.  The youngsters, not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there.  She felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her eyes to his defects of character, and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover.  Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the thatch.  A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted. Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions, folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter, with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood.  When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages were juxtaposed.  Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day.  She guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not divine that it solely concerned herself.  Dismissing this, however, she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the day-time, in company with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her sister Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called Liza-Lu, the youngest ones being put to bed.  There was an interval of four years and more between Tess and the next of the family, the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy, and this lent her a deputy-maternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors.  Next in juvenility to Abraham came two more girls, Hope and Modesty; then a boy of three, and then the baby, who had just completed his first year.  All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield ship--entirely dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield adults for their pleasures, their necessities, their health, even their existence.  If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them--six helpless creatures, who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of Durbeyfield.  Some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure, gets his authority for speaking of Natures holy plan.  It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared.  Tess looked out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott.  The village was shutting its eyes.  Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere: she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand.  Her mothers fetching simply meant one more to fetch.  Tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood.  Abraham, she said to her little brother, do you put on your hat--you baint afraid?--and go up to Rollivers, and see what has gone wi father and mother.  The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the night swallowed him up.  Half an hour passed yet again; neither man, woman, nor child returned.  Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.  I must go myself, she said.  Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.    IV   Rollivers inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village, could only boast of an off-licence; hence, as nobody could legally drink on the premises, the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long, fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, so as to form a ledge.  On this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank, and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia, and wished they could have a restful seat inside.  Thus the strangers.  But there were also local customers who felt the same wish; and where theres a will theres a way.  In a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady, Mrs Rolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all seeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott, and frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the distance to the The Pure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village, render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end; but the far more serious question, the quality of the liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house.  A gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded sitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides; a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers; another rested on the oak-carved cwoffer; two on the wash-stand; another on the stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their ease.  The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and spread their personalities warmly through the room.  In this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomons temple.  Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well.  Her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into the light above the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom.  --Being a few private friends Ive asked in to keep up club-walking at my own expense, the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps, as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over the stairs.  Oh, tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield--Lard--how you frightened me!--I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Goverment.  Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat.  He was humming absently to himself, in a low tone: I be as good as some folks here and there  Ive got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill, and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!  Ive something to tell ee thats come into my head about that--a grand projick whispered his cheerful wife.  Here, John, dont ee see me?  She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a window-pane, went on with his recitative.  Hush  Dont ee sing so loud, my good man, said the landlady; in case any member of the Goverment should be passing, and take away my licends.  Hes told ee whats happened to us, I suppose? asked Mrs Durbeyfield.  Yes--in a way.  Dye think theres any money hanging by it?  Ah, thats the secret, said Joan Durbeyfield sagely.  However, tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you dont ride in en.  She dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: Ive been thinking since you brought the news that theres a great rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o The Chase, of the name of dUrberville.  Hey--whats that? said Sir John.  She repeated the information.  That lady must be our relation, she said.  And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.  There IS a lady of the name, now you mention it, said Durbeyfield. Pason Tringham didnt think of that.  But shes nothing beside we--a junior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Normans day.  While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed, in their preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room, and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return.  She is rich, and shed be sure to take notice o the maid, continued Mrs Durbeyfield; and twill be a very good thing.  I dont see why two branches o one family should not be on visiting terms.  Yes; and well all claim kin! said Abraham brightly from under the bedstead.  And well all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her; and well ride in her coach and wear black clothes!  How do you come here, child?  What nonsense be ye talking!  Go away, and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready! ...  Well, Tess ought to go to this other member of our family.  Shed be sure to win the lady--Tess would; and likely enough twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her.  In short, I know it.  How?  I tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that very thing! ...  You should ha seen how pretty she looked to-day; her skin is as sumple as a duchess.  What says the maid herself to going?  Ive not asked her.  She dont know there is any such lady-relation yet.  But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage, and she wont say nay to going.  Tess is queer.  But shes tractable at bottom.  Leave her to me.  Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in store.  Tess is a fine figure o fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest, observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone.  But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she dont get green malt in floor.  It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning, and there was no reply.  The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below.  --Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up club-walking at my own expense.  The landlady had rapidly re-used the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was Tess.  Even to her mothers gaze the girls young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a reproachful flash from Tesss dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs Rollivers caution following their footsteps.  No noise, please, if yell be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my licends, and be summonsd, and I dont know what allNight tyeThey went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs Durbeyfield the other.  He had, in truth, drunk very little--not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but the weakness of Sir Johns constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind.  On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to London, and at another as if they were marching to Bath--which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so comic after all.  The two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield, their cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they approached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence--  Ive got a fam--ily vault at Kingsbere Hush--dont be so silly, Jacky, said his wife.  Yours is not the only family that was of count in wold days.  Look at the Anktells, and Horseys, and the Tringhams themselves--gone to seed amost as much as you--though you was bigger folks than they, thats true. Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way  Dont you be so sure o that.  From you nater tis my belief youve disgraced yourselves more than any o us, and was kings and queens outright at one time.  Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry--I am afraid father wont be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so early.  I? I shall be all right in an hour or two, said Durbeyfield.   It was eleven oclock before the family were all in bed, and two oclock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in Casterbridge before the Saturday market began, the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and the horse and waggon being of the slowest.  At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept.  The poor man cant go, she said to her eldest daughter, whose great eyes had opened the moment her mothers hand touched the door.  Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information.  But somebody must go, she replied.  It is late for the hives already.  Swarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off taking em till next weeks market the call for em will be past, and theyll be thrown on our hands.  Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency.  Some young feller, perhaps, would go?  One of them who were so much after dancing with ee yesterday, she presently suggested.  O no--I wouldnt have it for the world declared Tess proudly. And letting everybody know the reason--such a thing to be ashamed of I think _I_ could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company.  Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement.  Little Abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world. Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting a lantern, went out to the stable.  The rickety little waggon was already laden, and the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree less rickety than the vehicle.  The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the lantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at that hour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest, he was called upon to go out and labour.  They put a stock of candle-ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off-side of the load, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour.  To cheer themselves as well as they could, they made an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread and butter, and their own conversation, the real morning being far from come.  Abraham, as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far), began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a giants head.'

const junieb3 = 'My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except I dont like Beatrice. I just like B and thats all. I am almost six years old. Almost six is when you get to go to school. And so, last summer Mother took me to the school office. And she rolled me in afternoon kindergarten. Rolled is the grown-up word for signed me up and made me go. Only guess what? I dont even mind going there, hardly. Cause I made two bestest friends at that place, thats why! Their names are Lucille and that Grace. We are like three peas in a row. My teachers name is Mrs. She has another name, too. But I just like Mrs. and thats all. Only here is the trouble. Just when I was getting good at kindergarten, Mrs. made a nouncement to our class. And she said that pretty soon, school is going to end! I did a gasp at that terrible news. No, Mrs.! No, no, no! How can school end? Cause Mother said I have to go to school till I am an old teenager. And I am not even six years old yet! Mrs. quick shaked her head. Oh dear, Im sorry, Junie B., she said. Im afraid that youve misunderstood me. School isnt going to end forever. School will just be taking a summer vacation. She smiled at me. You, and everyone else in this class, will come back to school in September. Its just that you wont be in Room Nine anymore. I quick got out a paper and crayon. Okey-doke. Then tell me the name of our new room, I said. Cause I will need to tell Mother where to bring me. Mrs. did a little frown. Im sorry, she said again. But right now, I have no idea what room youll be in next year. Now I did a frown, too. So what am I sposed to do, then? Just wander around the school until I find you people? Mrs. looked funny at me. You still dont understand, she said. Next year youre going to have a different teacher, Junie B. Next year youre going to be in first. First what? I asked. First grade, she said. Just then, my stomach felt sickish inside. Cause I dont even like first graders, thats why. First graders are bullies to me at recess. And I dont want to be in the same room as those guys. Pretty soon, a boy named William started to sniffle very much. Cause William hates first graders even more than me. Thats because one time a first grader stoled Williams winter hat with the ear flaps. And he put it on a dog that was running around the playground. And the dog runned away with Williams ear-flap hat forever. I patted William very nice. Me and William dont want to be in the same room as first graders, I told Mrs. Me and William prefer children our own age. Me too, said my bestest friend Lucille. I prefer children my own age, too. Me too, hollered a boy named Paulie Allen Puffer. Me too, said a girl named Charlotte. Mrs. said shh to us. Boys and girls, please. Now everyone is misunderstanding me, she said. We need to get clear on this right now. Next year—when you come back to school—you will not be in class with the children who are first graders this year. Next year, those children will move up to second grade. And you people will move to first. Understand? I thought and thought about that. Then, all of a sudden, a light bulb came on in my head. Ohhh! I get it now! All of the grades move up! Right, Mrs.? Everyone does! She clapped her hands. Right! Exactly! she said very happy. Now may I please get on with my announcement? I brushed my skirt very smoothie. Yes, you may, I said real polite. Okay, said Mrs. As I started to tell you earlier, I have very happy news for Room Nine. Because this year—for the first time ever—we are going to go on a special end-ofthe-year field trip! She smiled real big. Were going to a farm! Doesnt that sound like fun? A FARM! shouted the children. A FARM! A FARM! WERE GOING TO A FARM! Then Lucille hugged me very thrilled. A farm! she said real squealy in my ear. A farm, I said real glum. Cause guess what? Farms are not my favorites. 2/Stubby That night, I ate dinner with Mother and Daddy and my baby brother named Ollie. Only I couldnt even swallow that good. Cause I was still upset about the field trip, thats why. I dont want to go, I said. I dont want to go to the farm with Room Nine. Cause a farm is the most dangerous place I ever heard of. Daddy looked surprised at me. What are you talking about, Junie B.? he said. Whats dangerous about a farm? The ponies, of course, I said. The ponies are dangerous. Farms have ponies running in their fields. And ponies can stomple you into the ground and kill you to death. Mother covered her face with her hands. No, Junie B., please. Not this pony thing again. Weve talked about this a hundred times. Ive told you over and over that ponies do not hurt you. Yes, they do too hurt you, Mother! I said. I saw it on TV with my own eyeballs! Mother looked at Daddy. It was that stupid cable show the babysitter let her watch, she said. It was called— WHEN PONIES ATTACK, I hollered. IT WAS CALLED WHEN PONIES ATTACK! After that, Daddy covered his face, too. Then, all of a sudden, he busted out in a loud hoot of laughing. And he couldnt even stop himself. Mothers cheeks sucked way into her head. Thank you, she said. Youre being a huge help here. Then Daddy got up from his chair. And he went to his room for a time-out. Thats when me and Mother had another long talk about ponies. She told me that her uncle Billy used to have a farm. And that the farm had a pony named Stubby. And that Stubby was gentle as a lamb. As a matter of fact, Uncle Billy had almost every kind of farm animal you can think of, said Mother. Pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, goats. He even had a mean old rooster named Spurs. But out of all those animals, the pony was the sweetest. Mother smiled. You would have loved Stubby, Junie B., she said. He used to follow me around like a puppy. He did? I said. He did, she said back. Honest, honey. I would never let you go to a farm if there was even the teeniest chance you would be hurt by any of the animals. But my uncle Billys farm had the gentlest animals I ever saw. Mother smiled a little bit. Well, except for that mean old rooster, anyway, she said. Just then, Daddy came back into the kitchen. He said a pology to me. Im sorry, Junie B. I didnt mean to laugh. But that TV show you saw was just so ridiculous, I couldnt help it. After that, he sat down at the table. And he filled out my permission slip for the farm. Youre going to love this trip, he told me. Well get you one of those little throwaway cameras from the drugstore. And you can take pictures of all the animals you see. Great idea, said Mother. And Ill take you shopping for a brand-new pair of overalls. And Ill even pack you your very favorite lunch. After that, I got down from my chair very quiet. And I went to my room. Then I climbed onto my bed. And I hugged my stuffed animals real tight. Cause I kept on thinking and thinking about what Mother said about Uncle Billys animals. But mostly, I kept thinking about that mean old rooster. On account of one time at my school, a boy named meanie Jim brought his rooster for Pet Day. And he said that roosters can peck your head into a nub. And that is not pleasant, I tell you. I hugged my animals even tighter. Cause guess what? Roosters are a jillion times scarier than ponies. 3/Pictures The next morning, Mother called me for breakfast. Good morning, said Mother. Good morning, said Daddy. Good morning, I said. Roosters can peck your head into a nub. Daddy put down his coffee cup. Excuse me? I pointed to my head. A nub, I explained. A nub is a teensy little knob head. Roosters can peck your head into one. Mother looked strange at me. What in the world is this about? I did a big breath at her. Cause how can I even be clearer on this subject? A nub! A nub! A roundish, ballish head knob! And do not tell me that roosters do not peck you. On account of we had Pet Day at my school. And meanie Jim brought a rooster to Room Nine. And that boy is a rooster expert. I looked at her. Plus also, you said Uncle Billys rooster was mean, too. Right, Mother? Remember that? Mother looked fusstrated at me. Then she put her head on the table. And she didnt come up for a real long time. Finally, she peeked her eyes at Daddy. Now what? she asked kind of quiet. Maybe itll blow over, said Daddy. I shook my head. No, it will not blow over, I told them. Cause roosters do not listen to reason. And so there is nothing we can do about this pecking situation. Daddy rubbed his eyes. Could we please just change the subject? he said. Yeah, only not talking about a nub will not make it go away, I said. And so— Thats enough, said Daddy very growly. I quick stopped talking then. But even after we changed the subject, nubs kept staying on my mind. That day at school, Mrs. told us to draw a picture about our trip to the farm. She said to make it a colorful picture of what we wanted to see there. I drawed and drawed. Plus also, I colored and colored. When all of us got done with our pictures, we sat our chairs in a big circle. And we told each other about what we drew. My bestest friend named Lucille went first. She drawed a picture of a pink flamingo. Flamingos are my favorite animals, she said. Thats because pink is my favorite color. And flamingos are pink. And I have a pink dress that will match them perfectly. So that is the dress Ill be wearing on the field trip. She wrinkled her nose real cute. Pink brings out the natural blush of my complexion, she told Mrs. Have you ever noticed my satiny-smooth skin? Mrs. looked and looked at that girl. Youre a fascinating child, Lucille. But Im afraid there arent any flamingos on a dairy farm, she said. Lucille looked surprised. So where are they, then? she asked. Well, flamingos can be found a lot of places, said Mrs. South America, for example. Lucille shrugged her shoulders. So, fine. Well just go there, instead. Mrs. said for Lucille to please sit down. Just then, Paulie Allen Puffer springed out of his chair. Look, Teacher! I drew a catfish! he said. See his whiskers? My brother said catfish whiskers are so sharp they can slice your finger to the bone. Mrs. made a sick face. Yes, well, thank you for sharing that, Paulie Allen. But were not going fishing. Were going to a farm, remember? Paulie Allen Puffer looked upset. Yes, but my brother said theres lots of catfish farms around here. And so thats the kind of farm I think we should— No, Paulie. No, said Mrs. Were just going to a regular, plain old farm. With regular, plain old farm animals. Paulie Allen Puffer did a mad breath. He said the word big whoop. After that, Paulie Allen Puffer had to stand in the hall. Mrs. did some deep breathing. Please, children. Please. Did anyone in Room Nine draw a picture of a regular farm animal? Anyone at all. Thats all Im looking for here. Just a regular old farm animal. I did! I did, Mrs.! I yelled real excited. I drew a picture of a rooster under a tree! Oh, Junie B.! Thank you! Thats perfect! she said. I holded it up so she could see it. See it, Mrs.? See how pretty it is? Mrs. looked at my picture. Oh yes. Thats a very nice tree, Junie B., she said. But why is it lying on its side? It crashed over in a rainstorm, I said. Oh, said Mrs. Oh dear. She looked even closer. But Im afraid I dont see the rooster, honey. I pointed. There, I said. See his foot under the branch? He did not get out in time, apparently. Mrs. covered her mouth with her hand. Just then, a girl named Charlotte hollered, I hate that picture! Thats a terrible picture! I crossed my arms at that girl. You would not say that if your head was a nub, sister, I said. Meanie Jim laughed real loud. Then Mrs. said for all of us to take our chairs back to our tables. And we did not show any more farm pictures. 4/Cockle-Doodly-Doo On Saturday, Mother came into my room. She said we were going shopping for clothes for the farm trip. I looked up from my coloring book. No thank you, I said. On account of I am getting a fever that day. So I wont actually be going to the farm. Mother laughed. Dont be silly, she said. Then she picked me up. And she carried me out to the car. Yeah, only heres the problem. You are not respecting my wishes, I said. Mother laughed some more. I promise. This will be fun. I did a huffy breath. Whatever, I said. Whatever is the grown-up word for that is the dumbest thing I ever heard. And guess what? I was right. Shopping was not fun at all. Cause Mother kept on making me try on clothes that I didnt want. First she made me try on a shirt with checkery squares. Then she made me try on overalls with big, giant pockets. Plus she tied a bandanna around my neck. And she put a straw hat on my head. I looked in the mirror at myself. What do you know…Im a cornball, I said. Only too bad for me. Cause Mother said I looked cute as a button. And she bought those clothes anyway. Plus also, she bought me a throw-away camera at the drugstore. After we got home, I started to color again. Mother hanged up my new clothes. Do you want me to show you how to use the camera for your trip now? she asked. No thank you, I said. On account of I am getting a fever that day. So I wont actually be going to the farm. After that, Mother did a big sigh. And she closed my door. And she let me color in peace. I got tricked! Cause on the day of the trip, I told Mother I had a fever. But that woman did not even take my word for it. Instead, she took my temperature! And so what kind of trust is that, I ask you? No fever, she said. Then Mother dressed me in my farm clothes. And she drove me right to my school. We pulled into the parking lot. Oh no! I said. Oh no! Oh no! Cause the bus was there for the field trip already! It was parked right at the curb! Believe me, Junie B., said Mother. You are going to have a great day. Then she got me out of the car. And she pulled me to my teacher. Good morning, Junie B., said Mrs. Dont you look cute today? I felt my forehead. Im ill, I said. Mrs. smiled. I love your straw hat. My head is a flaming fireball, I said. Mrs. bended down next to me. And that bandanna is absolutely darling. I am burning to a crinkle, I told her. Crisp, said Mother. Whatever, I said. After that, Mother lifted me onto the bus. And she handed me my backpack with my lunch and camera. She waved good-bye to me. I did not wave back. Cause my hand did not feel friendly. Just then, my bestest friend named Grace came running to get me. Junie B.! Junie B.! Lucille and I saved you a seat! Then she grabbed my arm. And she took me way in the back. I sat down next to Lucille. No! said that Grace. Thats my seat, Junie B.! She quick pulled me up. So where am I supposed to sit, then? I asked. Lucille pointed across the aisle. Right there, silly, she said. Youre sitting right directly across from Grace and me. And so its almost like were sitting together. Except you will be separate. I sat down. But theres nobody to talk to over here, I told her. Just then, that meanie Jim jumped up from the seat behind me. Me! You can talk to me! he said very laughing. Then he leaned into my ear. And he hollered, COCKLE-DOODLY-DOO! right into my eardrum. Too bad youre afraid of roosters, he said. Roosters can tell if youre afraid, Junie B. Ask anybody. Roosters always peck the scaredy-heads first. No, they do not, Jim! I said back. You are just making that up, probably. And anyhow, if roosters pecked peoples heads off, all farmers would have nub heads. Only they dont. So there. Ha ha. Jim raised up one eyebrow. Are you sure all farmers dont have nub heads? he said kind of spooky. Hmm? Are you? He did a grin. Why do you think farmers wear hats? Jim leaned closer. To cover up their nubs, thats why, he whispered. After that, he lifted up my hat. And he patted my head. And he cockle-doodly-dooed all over again. 5/E-I-E-I-O The bus drove for a very long time. Paulie Allen Puffer was sitting with that Jim I hate. While we were riding, he stood up behind me. Junie B.! Junie B.! Listen to the song we just made up!” he said. Then he and Jim started singing their song as loud as they could'

const charlotteweb = 'Wheres Papa going with the ax? said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast. Out to the hoghouse, replied Mrs. Arable. Some pigs were born last night. I dont see why he needs an ax, continued Fern, who was only eight. Well, said her mother,one of the pigs is a runt. Its very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it. Do away with it? shrieked Fern. You mean kill it? Just because its smaller than the others? Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. Dont yell, Fern!she said. Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway. Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors. The grass was wet and the earth smelled of springtime. Ferns sneakers were sopping by the time she caught up with her father. Please dont kill it! she sobbed. Its unfair. Mr. Arable stopped walking. Fer, he said gently, you will have to learn to control yourself. Control myself? yelled Fern. This is a matter of life and death, and you talk about controlling myself. Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her fathers hand. Fern, said Mr. Arable, I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along! But its unfair, cried Fern. The pig couldnt help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me? Mr. Arable smiled. Certainly not, he said, looking down at his daughter with love. But this is different. A little girl is one thing, a little runty pig is another. I see no difference, replied Fern, still hanging on to the ax. This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of. A queer look came over John Arables face. He seemed almost ready to cry himself. All right, he said.You go back to the house and I will bring the runt when I come in. Ill let you start it on a bottle, like a baby. Then youll see what trouble a pig can be. When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an hour later, he carried a carton under his arm. Fern was upstairs changing her sneakers. The kitchen table was set for breakfast, and the room smelled of coffee, bacon, damp plaster, and wood smoke from the stove. Put it on her chair! said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable set the carton down at Ferns place. Then he walked to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel. Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise.. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink. Hes yours, said Mr. Arable. Saved from an untimely death. And may the good Lord forgive me for this foolishness. Fern couldnt take her eyes off the tiny pig. Oh, she whispered. Oh, look at him! Hes absolutely perfect. She closed the carton carefully. First she kissed her father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against her cheek. At this moment her brother Avery came into the room. Avery was ten. He was heavily armed--an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other. Whats that? he demanded. Whats Fern got? Shes got a guest for breakfast, said Mrs. Arable. Wash your hands and face, Avery! Lets see it! said Avery, setting his gun down. You call that miserable thing a pig? Thats a fine specimen of a pig--its no bigger than a white rat. Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery! said his mother. The school bus will be along in half an hour. Can I have a pig, too, Pop? asked Avery. No, I only distribute pigs to early risers, said Mr. Arable. Fern was up at daylight, trying to rid world of injustice. As a result, she now has a pig. A small one, to be sure, but nevertheless a pig. It just shows what can happen if a person gets out of bed promptly. Lets eat! But Fern couldnt eat until her pig had had a drink of milk. Mrs. Arable found a babys nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. Give him his breakfast! she said. A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig, although tiny, had a good appetite and caught on quickly. The school bus honked from the road. Run! commanded Mrs. Arable, taking the pig from Fern and slipping a doughnut into her hand. Avery grabbed his gun and another doughnut. The children ran out to the road and climbed into the bus. Fern took no notice of the others in the bus. She just sat and stared out of the window, thinking what a blissful world it was and how lucky she was to have entire charge of a pig. By the time the bus reached school, Fern had named her pet, selecting the most beautiful name she could think of. Its name is Wilbur, she whispered to herself. She was still thinking about the pig when the teacher said: Fern, what is the capital of Pennsylvania? Wilbur, replied Fern, dreamily. The pupils giggled. Fern blushed. II. Wilbur Fern loved Wilbur more than anything. She loved to stroke him, to feed him, to put him to bed. Every morning, as soon as she got up, she warmed his milk, tied his bib on, and held the bottle for him. Every afternoon, when the school bus stopped in front of her house, she jumped out and ran to the kitchen to fix another bottle for him. She fed him again at suppertime, and again just before going to bed. Mrs. Arable gave him a feeding around noontime each day, when Fern was away in school. Wilbur loved his milk, and he was never happier than when Fern was warming up a bottle for him. He would stand and gaze up at her with adoring eyes. For the first few days of his life, Wilbur was allowed to live in a box near the stove in the kitchen. Then when Mrs. Arable complained, he was moved to a bigger box in the woodshed. At two weeks of age, he was moved outdoors. It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased. Wont he be cold at night? asked Fern. No, said her father. Your watch and see what he does. Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted. It relieved her mind to know that her baby would sleep covered up, and would stay warm. Every morning after breakfast, Wilbur walked out to the road with Fern and waited with her till the bus came. She would wave good-bye to him, and he would stand and watch the bus until it vanished around a turn. While Fern was in school, Wilbur was shut up inside his yard. But as soon as she got home in the afternoon, she would take him out and he would follow her around the place. If she went into the house, Wilbur went, too. If she went upstairs, Wilbur would wait at the bottom step until she came down again. If she took her doll for a walk in the doll carriage, Wilbur followed along. Sometimes, on these journeys, Wilbur would get tired, and Fern would pick him up and put him in the carriage alongside the doll. He liked this. And if he was very tired, he would close his eyes and go to sleep under the dolls blanket. He looked cute when his eyes were closed, because his lashes were so long. The doll would close her eyes, too, and Fern would wheel the carriage very slowly and smoothly so as not to wake her infants. One warm afternoon, Fern and Avery put on bathing suits and went down to the brook for a swim. Wilbur tagged along at Ferns heels. When she waded into the brook, Wilbur waded in with her. He found the water quite cold--too cold for his liking. So while the children swam and played and splashed water at each other, Wilbur amused himself in the mud along the edge of the brook, where it was warm and moist and delightfully sticky and oozy. Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful. Wilbur was what farmers call a spring pig, which simply means that he was born in springtime. When he was five weeks old, Mr. Arable said he was now big enough to sell, and would have to be sold. Fern broke down and wept. But her father was firm about it. Wilburs appetite had increased; he was beginning to eat scraps of food in addition to milk. Mr. Arable was not willing to provide for him any longer. He had already sold Wilburs ten brothers and sisters. Hes got to go, Fern, he said. You have had your fun raising a baby pig, but Wilbur is not a baby any longer and he has got to be sold. Call up the Zuckermans, suggested Mrs. Arable to Fern. Your Uncle Homer sometimes raises a pig. And if Wilbur goes there to live, you can walk down the road and visit him as often as you like. How much money should I ask for him? Fern wanted to know. Well, said her father, hes a runt. Tell your Uncle Homer youve got a pig youll sell for six dollars, and see what he says. It was soon arranged. Fern phoned and got her Aunt Edith, and her Aunt Edith hollered for Uncle Homer, and Uncle Homer came in from the barn and talked to Fern. When he heard that the price was only six dollars, he said he would buy the pig. Next day Wilbur was taken from his home under the apple tree and went to live in a manure pile in the cellar of Zuchkermans barn.'

const prideprej = 'But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not.  You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.  I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.  They have none of them much to recommend them, replied he; they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.  Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.  You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.  Ah! you do not know what I suffer.  But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.  It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.  Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.  Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.     CHAPTER II.   Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,  I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy.  We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes, said her mother resentfully, since we are not to visit.  But you forget, mama, said Elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.  I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.  No more have I, said Mr. Bennet; and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.  Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.  Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for heavens sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.  Kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times them ill.  I do not cough for my own amusement, replied Kitty fretfully.  When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?  To-morrow fortnight.  Aye, so it is, cried her mother, and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.  Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.  Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?  I honour your circumspection. A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.  The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, Nonsense, nonsense!  What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he. Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts.  Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.  While Mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to Mr. Bingley.  I am sick of Mr. Bingley, cried his wife.  I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.  The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.  How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.  Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse, said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.  What an excellent father you have, girls, said she, when the door was shut. I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.  Oh! said Lydia stoutly, I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, Im the tallest.  The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennets visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.     CHAPTER III.   Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingleys heart were entertained.  If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield, said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.  In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennets visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.'

const prideprej2 = 'The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.  An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.  Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.  Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.  Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.  "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."  "I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."  "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."  "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.  "Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."  "Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."  Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.  The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.  "Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----"  "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For Gods sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"  "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hursts gown----"  Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.  "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man."     CHAPTER IV.   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.  "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"  "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."  "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."  "Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."  "Dear Lizzy!"  "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in any body. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."  "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think."  "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every bodys character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this mans sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."  "Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."  Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.  Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.  His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.  Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcys regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.  The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.  Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.     CHAPTER V.   Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. Jamess had made him courteous.  Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.--They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeths intimate friend.  That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.  "_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingleys first choice."  "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."  "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice. To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson."  "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsons asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."  "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."  "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."  "I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."  "Are you quite sure, Maam?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."  "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."  "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable.'

const greatexpectations = 'As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times. My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our breadand-butter for us, that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib - where it sometimes got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaister - using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaister, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other. 15 of 865 Great Expectations On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread-andbutter down the leg of my trousers. The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose, I found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water. And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our alreadymentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each other’s admiration now and then - which stimulated us to new exertions. Tonight, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast-diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread-andbutter on the other. At last, I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had 16 of 865 Great Expectations best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread-andbutter down my leg. Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw that my bread-and-butter was gone. The wonder and consternation'

const mixedupfiles = 'Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of  running away. That is, running away in the heat of anger with a knapsack  on her back. She didnt like discomfort; even picnics were untidy and  inconvenient: all those insects and the sun melting the icing on the  cupcakes. Therefore, she decided that her leaving home would not be just  running from somewhere but would be running to somewhere. To a large  place, a comfortable place, an indoor place, and preferably a beautiful  place. And thats why she decided upon the Metropolitan Museum of Art in  New York City.   She planned very carefully; she saved her allowance and she chose her  companion. She chose Jamie, the second youngest of her three younger  brothers. He could be counted on to be quiet, and now and then he was good  for a laugh. Besides, he was rich; unlike most boys his age, he had never  even begun collecting baseball cards. He saved almost every penny he got.   But Claudia waited to tell Jamie that she had decided upon him. She  couldnt count on him to be that quiet for that long. And she calculated  needing that long to save her weekly allowances. It seemed senseless to  run away without money. Living in the suburbs had taught her that  everything costs.   She had to save enough for train fare and a few expenses before she  could tell Jamie or make final plans. In the meantime she almost forgot  why she was running away. But not entirely. Claudia knew that it had to do  with injustice. She was the oldest child and the only girl and was subject  to a lot of injustice. Perhaps it was because she had to both empty the  dishwasher and set the table on the same night while her brothers got out  of everything. And, perhaps, there was another reason more clear to me  than to Claudia. A reason that had to do with the sameness of each and  every week. She was bored with simply being straight-As Claudia Kincaid.  She was tired of arguing about whose turn it was to choose the Sunday  night seven-thirty television show, of injustice, and of the monotony of  everything.   The fact that her allowance was so small that it took her more than  three weeks of skipping hot fudge sundaes to save enough for train fare  was another example of injustice. (Since you always drive to the city,  Saxonberg, you probably dont know the cost of train fare. Ill tell you.  Full fare one way costs one dollar and sixty cents. Claudia and Jamie  could each travel for half of that since she was one month under twelve,  and Jamie was well under twelve ?being only nine.) Since she intended to  return home after everyone had learned a lesson in Claudia appreciation,  she had to save money for her return trip, too, which was like full fare  one way. Claudia knew that hundreds of people who lived in her town worked  in offices in New York City and could afford to pay full fare both ways  every day. Like her father. After all, Greenwich was considered an actual  suburb of New York, a commuting suburb.   Even though Claudia knew that New York City was not far away, certainly  not far enough to go considering the size and number of the injustices done to her, she knew that it was a good place to get lost. Her mothers  Mah-Jong club ladies called it the city. Most of them never ventured  there; it was exhausting, and it made them nervous. When she was in the  fourth grade, her class had gone on a trip to visit historical places in  Manhattan. Johnathan Richters mother hadnt let him go for fear hed get  separated from the group in all the jostling that goes on in New York.  Mrs. Richter, who was something of a character, had said that she was  certain that he would come home lost. And she considered the air very  bad for him to breathe.   Claudia loved the city because it was elegant; it was important; and  busy. The best place in the world to hide. She studied maps and the  Tourguide book of the American Automobile Association and reviewed every  field trip her class had ever taken. She made a specialized geography  course for herself. There were even some pamphlets about the museum around  the house, which she quietly researched.   Claudia also decided that she must get accustomed to giving up things.  Learning to do without hot fudge sundaes was good practice for her. She  made do with the Good Humor bars her mother always kept in their freezer.  Normally, Claudias hot fudge expenses were forty cents per week. Before  her decision to run away, deciding what to do with the ten cents left over  from her allowance had been the biggest adventure she had had each week.  Sometimes she didnt even have ten cents, for she lost a nickel every time  she broke one of the household rules like forgetting to make her bed in  the morning. She was certain that her allowance was the smallest in her  class. And most of the other sixth graders never lost part of their pay  since they had full-time maids to do the chores instead of a cleaning lady  only twice a week. Once after she had started saving, the drug store had a  special. HOT FUDGE, 27c, the sign in the window said. She bought one. It  would postpone her running away only twenty-seven cents worth. Besides,  once she made up her mind to go, she enjoyed the planning almost as much  as she enjoyed spending money. Planning long and well was one of her  special talents .   Jamie, the chosen brother, didnt even care for hot fudge sundaes  although he could have bought one at least every other week. A year and a  half before, Jamie had made a big purchase; he had spent his birthday  money and part of his Christmas money on a transistor radio, made in  Japan, purchased from Woolworths. Occasionally, he bought a battery for  it. They would probably need the radio; that made another good reason for  choosing Jamie.   On Saturdays Claudia emptied the wastebaskets, a task she despised.  There were so many of them. Everyone in her family had his own bedroom and  wastebasket except her mother and father who shared both ?with each other.  Almost every Saturday Steve emptied his pencil sharpener into his. She  knew he made his basket messy on purpose.   One Saturday as she was carrying the basket from her parents room, she  jiggled it a little so that the contents would sift down and not spill out  as she walked. Their basket was always so full since there were two of  them using it. She managed to shift a shallow layer of Kleenex, which her  mother had used for blotting lipstick, and thus exposed the corner of a  red ticket. Using the tips of her forefinger and thumb like a pair of  forceps, she pulled at it and discovered a ten ride pass for the New York,  New Haven, and Hartford Railroad. Used train passes normally do not appear  in suburban wastebaskets; they appear in the pockets of train conductors.  Nine rides on a pass are marked off in little squares along the bottom  edge, and they are punched one at a time as they are used; for the tenth  ride the conductor collects the pass. Their cleaning lady who had come on     Friday must have thought that the pass was all used up since rides one  through nine were already punched. The cleaning lady never went to New  York, and Claudias dad never kept close track of his pocket change or his  train passes.   Both she and Jamie could travel on the leftover pass since two half  fares equal one whole. Now they could board the train without having to  purchase tickets. They would avoid the station master and any stupid  questions he might ask. What a find! From a litter of lipstick kisses,  Claudia had plucked a free ride. She regarded it as an invitation. They  would leave on Wednesday.   On Monday afternoon Claudia told Jamie at the school bus stop that she  wanted him to sit with her because she had something important to tell  him. Usually, the four Kincaid children neither waited for each other nor  walked together, except for Kevin who was somebodys charge each week.  School had begun on the Wednesday after Labor Day. Therefore, their  fiscal week as Claudia chose to call it began always on Wednesday. Kevin  was only six and in the first grade and was made much over by everyone,  especially by Mrs. Kincaid, Claudia thought. Claudia also thought that he  was terribly babied and impossibly spoiled. You would think that her  parents would know something about raising children by the time Kevin,  their fourth, came along. But her parents hadnt learned. She couldnt  remember being anyones charge when she was in the first grade. Her mother  had simply met her at the bus stop every day.   Jamie wanted to sit with his buddy, Bruce. They played cards on the  bus; each day meant a continuation of the day before. (The game was  nothing very complicated, Saxonberg. Nothing terribly refined. They played  war, that simple game where each player puts down a card, and the higher  card takes both. If the cards are the same, there is a war which involves  putting down more cards; winner then takes all the war cards.) Every night  when Bruce got off at his stop, hed take his stack of cards home with  him. Jamie would do the same. They always took a vow not to shuffle. At  the stop before Bruce s house, they would stop playing, wrap a rubber band  around each pile, hold the stack under each others chin and spit on each  others deck saying, Thou shalt not shuffle. Then each tapped his deck  and put it in his pocket.   Claudia found the whole procedure disgusting, so she suffered no  feelings of guilt when she pulled Jamie away from his precious game. Jamie  was mad, though. He was in no mood to listen to Claudia. He sat slumped in  his seat with his lips pooched out and his eyebrows pulled down on top of  his eyes. He looked like a miniature, clean-shaven Neanderthal man.  Claudia didnt say anything. She waited for him to cool off.   Jamie spoke first, Gosh, Claude, why dont you pick on Steve?   Claudia answered, I thought, Jamie, that youd see that its obvious I  dont want Steve.   Well,  Jamie pleaded, want him! Want him!    Claudia had planned her speech. I want you, Jamie, for the greatest  adventure in our lives.   Jamie muttered, Well, I wouldnt mind if youd pick on someone else.   Claudia looked out the window and didnt answer. Jamie said, As long  as youve got me here, tell me.     Claudia still said nothing and still looked out the window. Jamie  became impatient. I said that as long as youve got me here, you may as  well tell me .    Claudia remained silent. Jamie erupted, Whats the matter with you,  Claude? First you bust up my card game, then you dont tell me. Its  undecent .    Break up, not bust up. Indecent, not undecent, Claudia corrected.   Oh, boloney! You know what I mean. Now tell me, he demanded.   Ive picked you to accompany me on the greatest adventure of our  mutual lives, Claudia repeated.   You said that. He clenched his teeth. Now tell me.   Ive decided to run away from home, and Ive chosen you to accompany     me .     Why pick on me? Why not pick on Steve? he asked.   Claudia sighed, I dont want Steve. Steve is one of the things in my  life that Im running away from. I want you.   Despite himself, Jamie felt flattered. (Flattery is as important a  machine as the lever, isnt it, Saxonberg? Give it a proper place to rest,  and it can move the world.) It moved Jamie. He stopped thinking, Why pick  on me? and started thinking, I am chosen. He sat up in his seat,  unzipped his jacket, put one foot up on the seat, placed his hands over  his bent knee and said out of the corner of his mouth, O.K., Claude, when  do we bust out of here? And how?   Claudia stifled the urge to correct his grammar again. On Wednesday.  Heres the plan. Listen carefully.   Jamie squinted his eyes and said, Make it complicated, Claude. I like  complications .    Claudia laughed. Its got to be simple to work. Well go on Wednesday  because Wednesday is music lesson day. Im taking my violin out of its  case and am packing it full of clothes . You do the same with your trumpet  case. Take as much clean underwear as possible and socks and at least one  other shirt with you.   All in a trumpet case? I should have taken up the bass fiddle.   You can use some of the room in my case. Also use your book bag. Take  your transistor radio.   Can I wear sneakers? Jamie asked.   Claudia answered, Of course. Wearing shoes all the time is one of the  tyrannies youll escape by coming with me.   Jamie smiled, and Claudia knew that now was the correct time to ask.  She almost managed to sound casual. And bring all your money. She  cleared her throat. By the way, how much money do you have?   Jamie put his foot back down on the floor, looked out the window and  said, Why do you want to know?     For goodness sake, Jamie, if were in this together, then were  together. Ive got to know. How much do you have?   Can I trust you not to talk? he asked.   Claudia was getting mad. Did I ask you if I could trust you not to  talk? She clamped her mouth shut and let out twin whiffs of air through  her nostrils; had she done it any harder or any louder, it would have been  called a snort.   Well, you see, Claude, Jamie whispered, I have guite a lot of  money.    Claudia thought that old Jamie would end up being a business tycoon  someday. Or at least a tax attorney like their grandfather. She said  nothing to Jamie.   Jamie continued, Claude, dont tell Mom or Dad, but I gamble. I play  those card games with Bruce for money. Every Friday we count our cards,  and he pays me. Two cents for every card I have more than he has and five  cents for every ace. And I always have more cards than he has and at least  one more ace .    Claudia lost all patience. Tell me how much you have! Four dollars?  Five? How much?   Jamie nuzzled himself further into the corner of the bus seat and sang,  Twenty-four dollars and forty- three cents. Claudia gasped, and Jamie,  enjoying her reaction, added, Hang around until Friday and Ill make it  twenty- five even.   How can you do that? Your allowance is only twenty-five cents. Twenty-  four forty-three plus twenty-five cents makes only twenty-four dollars and  sixty-eight cents. Details never escaped Claudia.'

const seusshits = 'One fish two fish red fish blue fish. Say! what a lot of fish there are. This one has a little star. Yes. Some are red, some are old and some are blue, and some are new. Some are thin The fat one has a yellow hat. And some are fat. Where do they come from? I can’t say. But I bet they have come a long, long way. Some are sad. And some are glad. And some are very, very bad. Why are they sad and glad and bad? I do not know. Go ask your dad. Not one of them is like another. Don’t ask us why, go ask your mother. This was no time for play. This was no time for fun. This was no time for games. There was work to be done. All the deep, deep, deep snow All that snow had to go. When our mother went down to the town for the day, She said, "Somebody has to clean all this away. Somebody, Somebody has to, you see." Then she picked out two somebodies: Sally and me. Well…there we were. We were working like that And then who should come up But the CAT IN THE HAT! “Oh-oh!” Sally said. “Don’t you talk to that cat. That cat is a bad one, That Cat in the Hat. He plays lots of bad tricks. Don’t you let him come near. You know what he did the last time he was here.” “Play tricks?” laughed the cat. “Oh, my my! No, no, no! I just want to go in To get out of the snow. Keep your mind on your work. You just stay there, you two. I will go in the house and find something to do.” Then the cat went right in! He was up to no good! So I ran in after as fast as I could! Do you know where I found him? You know where he was? He was eating a cake in the tub! Yes he was! The hot water was on and the cold water, too. And I said to the cat, “What a bad thing to do!” “But I like to eat cake in a tub,” laughed the cat. “You should try it sometime,” laughed the cat as he sat. And then I got mad. This was no time for fun. I said, “Cat! You get out! There is work to be done. I have no time for tricks. I must go back and dig. I can’t have you in here eating cake like a pig! You get out of this house! We don’t want you about!” Then I shut off the water and let it run out. The water ran out and then I saw THE RING! A ring in the tub! And, oh boy! What a thing! A big long pink cat ring! It looked like pink ink! And I said, “Will this ever come off? I don’t think!” “Have no fear of that ring” laughed the cat in the hat. Why, I can take cat rings off tubs just like that!” Do you know how he did it? WITH MOTHER’S WHITE DRESS! Now the tub was all clean, but her dress was a mess! Then Sally looked in. Sally saw the dress, too! And Sally and I did not know what to do. We should work in the snow but that dress! What a spot! “It may never come off!” Sally said. “It may not!” “Ho Ho, I can make the spot go. The way I take spots off a dress is just so! See here!” laughed the cat. “It is not hard at all. The thing that takes spots off a dress is a wall.” Then we saw the cat wipe the spot off the dress. Now the dress was all clean but the wall! What a mess! “Oh, wall spots!” he laughed. “Let me tell you some news. To take spots off a wall, all I need is two shoes!” Whose shoes did he use? I looked and saw whose! And I said to the cat, “This is very bad news. Now the spot is all over dad’s 10 dollar shoes!” “But your dad will not know about that,” said the cat. “He will never find out,” laughed the cat in the hat. “His $10 shoes will have no spots at all. I will rub them right off on this rug in the hall.” “But now we have rug spots!” I yelled. “What a day! Rug spots! What next? Can you take them away?” “Don’t ask me,” he laughed. “Why, you know that I can!” Then he picked up the rug and away the cat ran. “I can clean up these rug spots before you count three! No spots are too hard for a Hat Cat like me!” He ran into Dad’s bedroom and then the cat said, “It is good that your dad has the right kind of bed.” Then he shook the rug! CRACK! Now the bed had the spot! And all I could say was,“Now what, Cat? Now what?” But the cat stood still. He just looked at the bed. “This is not the right kind of bed,” the cat said. “To take spots off THIS bed will be hard,” said the cat. I can’t do it alone,” said the cat in the hat. “It is good I have someone to help me” he said. “Right here in my hat on the top of my head! It is good that I have him here with me today. He helps me a lot, this is  A. “ And then  A took the hat off his head. “It is good I have someone to help me,” he said. “This is   and I keep him about, and when I need help then I let him out.” Then B said, “I think we need  . That spot is too much for the A cat and me. But now, have no fear! We will clean it away! The three of us! Come on! Take it away!” yelled  A. I will hit that old spot with this broom! Do you see? It comes off the old bed! It goes on the T.V.” And then  cleaned up the T.V. He cleaned it with milk, put the spot in a pan! And then blew it out of the house with a fan! “But look where it went!” I said. “Look where it blew! You blew the mess out of the house. That is true. But now you made Snow Spots! You can’t let THEM stay!” “Let us think about that now,” said. “With some help, we can do it!” said  . Then POP! On his head we saw  ! Then, POP! POP! POP!  “We will clean up that snow if it takes us all day! If it takes us all night, we will clean it away!” said  They ran out of the house then and we ran out, too. And the big cat laughed, “Ha ha, now you will see something new. My cats are all clever. My cats are good shots My cats have good guns, they will kill all those spots.” But this did not look very clever to me. Kill snow spots with pop guns? That just couldn’t be. “All this does is make more spots,” we yelled at the cat. “Your cats are no good. Put them back in your hat. Take your  Put them back in your hat and take them away!“ “Oh, no!” said the cat. “All they need is more help. Help is all that they need. So keep still and don’t yelp. Then Little  took the hat off his head. “I have  H here to help us” he said. But our work is so hard We must have more than them. We need . “Come on! Get rid of those spots!” said the cats. “Get rid of the mess!” And they jumped at the snow with long rakes and red bats. They put it in pails and they made high pink hills! Pink snow men! Pink snow balls! And little pink pills! Oh, the things that they did and they did them so hard. It was all one big spot now all over the yard! But the Big Cat stood there and he said, “This is good. This is what they should do and I knew that they would. With a little more help all the work will be done. They need one more cat and I know just the one. Look close in my hand. I have  On his head are Cats is too small to see so don’t try. You cannot. But  is the cat who will clean up that spot! Now here is the  you can’t see,” said the cat. And I bet you can’t guess what he has in his hat. He has something called VOOM. VOOM is so hard to get You never saw anything like it, I bet. Why VOOM cleans up anything, clean as can be. The he yelled, “Take your hat off now. Take the VOOM off our head. Make it clean up the snow, Hurry you  one, two, three go.” Then the Voom… it went VOOM! And, oh boy! What a VOOM! Now don’t ask me what Voom is. I never will know. But, boy! Let me tell you it DOES clean up snow! “Ha ha, So you see!” laughed the cat. “Now your snow is all white! Now your work is all done! Now your house is all right! And you know where my little cats are?” said the cat. “That Voom blew my little cats back in my hat. And so, if you ever have spots, now and then, I will be very happy to come here again… With Little Cats'
