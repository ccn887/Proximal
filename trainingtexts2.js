Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books. Jack and Anniesoon discovered that thetree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. Allthey had to do was point to a pictureand wish to go there. Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan isa magicallibrarian fromthetime of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books. In Magic Tree House Books, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In books, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. In Magic Tree House Books, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories frombeing lost forever. Now, in book #, they areabout to begin a newset ofadventures Jack opened hiseyes. It was a stormy night. The rain tapped hard on his windowpane. Do you hear what therain is saying?said a voice. Jack turned on his lamp. Annie stood in his doorway. She wore her rain poncho over her pajamas and held a flashlight. Its saying, Come nowshesaid. Youre nuts,said Jack. Listen, just listen,said Annie. Jack listened. Therain did seemto be tapping out Come now Come now We have to go to the tree house,said Annie.Something important is about to happen. Now?said Jack. Jack didnt want to leave his warm, cozy room. But he had a feeling Annie was right. Something important was about to happen. You coming?she said. Yeah, yeah, hesaid. He climbed out of bed. Just put on your rain poncho,said Annie. Jack threw his rain poncho over his pajamas. He pulled on his sneakers and grabbed his backpack. Dont forget your Master Librarian card,said Annie.I have mine withme. Jack put the card with the glowing letters MLon it into his backpack. Im ready, hesaid. Jack and Annie went quietly down thestairs. Then they slipped out the door into the chilly, damp night. The storm had eased up. Rain fell gently they ran up the street. The wet ground glistened in the beam of the flashlight. They headed into the Frog Creek woods. Wind blew through the trees, shaking water to They headed into the Frog Creek woods. Wind blew through the trees, shaking water to the ground. Jack shivered. He wiped raindrops off his glasses. Brrr,said Annie. Im cold. Me, too,said Jack. As they kept walking, Annie pointed the flashlight up into thetrees. Thereit is,shesaid. Her light had found thetree house. MorganJack called. There was no answer. I wonder whats wrong,said Annie.I was sure shed be here. Lets go up and see,said Jack. Annie grabbed the ropeladder and started climbing. Jack followed. Rain dripped from the trees onto his poncho. They climbed into the tree house. Annie shined her light into each corner. The first three corners were empty. Then the flashlight beam hit the fourth. Jack and Annie gasped with surprise. Sitting in the corner was a small dog. He looked like a terrier puppy. He had scruffy light brown fur. Hestared sadly at Jack and Annie. Oh whispered Annie. Where did you come from?said Jack. Annie patted the dogs head. He wagged his tail. Hes so cute,she said.He looks like a little teddy bear. Hi, Teddy. Teddywasactually a good namefor him, Jack thought. Where did you comefrom, Teddy? he asked. The little dog whimpered. Dont be sad,said Annie.Everythings okay. Howdid he get up here?Jack asked. I dont know. But I bet Morgan had something to do with it,said Annie. Jacks gaze fell on a piece of paper lying on thefloor. I think youreright, hesaid. He picked up the paper. On it was fancy writing that said: This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things: Agift fromaship lostatsea, Agift fromthe prairie blue, Agift fromaforest faraway, A gift froma kangaroo. Be wise. Be brave. Becareful. Morgan P.S. Your Master Librarian cards wont help on this mission. Just be yourselves and all will be well. What kind of spell do you think Teddy is under?said Annie. Who knows?said Jack. Poor thing,said Annie. She patted the dogs head. Helicked her hand. It looks like we haveto takefour trips,said Jack. Teddy trotted over to a book. He pushed it with his nose. Looksaid Annie.I bet that willtake us on thefirst trip. She picked up the book that the little dog had chosen. Good job, Teddy,she said. The title ofthe book was The Unsinkable Ship. Well,at least thats good,said Jack.Theship wontsink,even ifit is lost. Ready, Teddy?asked Annie. Arf Arf he answered. Jack pointed at the cover of the book. I wish we could go there, hesaid. We will. Dont worrysaid Jack. Wait,said Lucy. She reached into hercoat pocket and pulled out a silver watch on a chain. This is a gift for both of you, she said. Its our fathers watch. We carried it on the voyage for good luck. I have a feeling that the two of you were our good luck tonight. Jack looked at the watch as Lucy put it around Annies neck. The time on the watchwas :. There were only thirty minutes left Hurry, hurry he said. Jack and Annie watched as a big man picked Lucy up and swung her into the little boat. Then he picked William up'

But there was nothing he could do as Annie disappeared fromsight. Anniecried Jack. Letme out he heard Annieshout. But thelifeboat kept going down. Wait for mecame a loud voice.Wait for me A woman in a fur coat appeared at therailing. She nearly threw herself over the side ofthe ship.Stopthe uniformed man called.Bring the boat back up for Lady Blackwell Slowly, the lifeboat was brought back up. Jack pushed his way forward. The lifeboat came even with the ship. Jack reached out to Annie. She grabbed his hands. He pulled her back onto thesinking ship. Roomfor one moreAnnie shouted to Lady Blackwell. Then sheand Jack took off beforeanyonecould catch them. They ran up theslanting deck. Anniestopped and peered over therailing. Jack looked, too. They saw Lucy and Williams little lifeboat creaking down toward the Atlantic Ocean. It reached the glassy black water. Then it floated offinto the darkness. Annie waved. Bye, William Bye, Lucyshe shouted.Thank you for your gift She held up the watch that hung from her neck. Then she and Jack looked at it. Thetime was  Only fifteen minutes leftsaid Annie. We have to get back to the tree house now said Jack. Lets climb the stairs to the smokestacks Suddenly, the front of the ship dipped down into thesea. Deck chairs started to slide past Jack and Annie. The band played a slow, calm song. It sounded like a church hymn. But the crowd started to panic. People pushed and shouted, trying to get to a safer part of the ship. Its every man for himself the captain shouted to all of hiscrew. The men all stopped what they were doing and ran up the deck. Jack and Annie ran, too. They dodged sliding tables and chairs. They reached the stairs that led to the smokestacks. They grabbed the railing and pulled themselves up the steps. The ship tilted further. Get to those smokestackscried Jack. They slipped and crawled down the deck. But when they got to the smokestacks, Jack and Annie looked around wildly. The magic tree house was gone Where is it? shouted Annie. The front ofthe Titanic sank deeper into thesea. Jack and Annie fell forward. They grabbed therailing and held on for their lives. Maybe the tree house fell into the oceanshouted Jack. Agreat roar started coming from the ship. Jack imagined everything crashing forward—all the furniture, dishes, bicycles, the grand clock on the staircase. He looked down. Agiant wave ofwater rolled overalower deck. Jack imagined water flooding the third-class corridor, the card room, and the grand staircase. He closed his eyes, waiting to be washed away. ArfArf The barking came from a distance. Teddycried Annie. Jack had forgotten all about the little dog. Holding on to the railing, he used one hand to pull off his knapsack. Teddy wasnt there There was more frantic barking. Wheres Teddy?cried Jack. Hes calling usshouted Annie. We cant look for himshouted Jack.Well fall off the ship Teddy barked and barked. Hes close bysaid Annie. She held on to the railing and moved slowly down the steep deck. Anniecried Jack. Suddenly, the lights on the Titanic went out. The world was pitch-dark. Jack couldnt see Annie at all. Annie he shouted. He tried to move down the deck, too. But the ship tilted again. Jack slipped and fell. He rolled until he crashed into a smokestack. Jackcried Annie.Here Here Teddy kept barking. The back of the Titanic was rising out of the ocean. The front of the ship was going down. Jack tried to go around the smokestack without falling. In the dark, he could barely see the tree house. It was stuck between a smokestack and the railing. It was lying on its side. Annie and Teddy were looking out the window. Teddys barking led me herecried Annie. Hurry, Jack Jack crawled around the smokestack. He held out his hand. Annie grabbed it. She pulled himinto thetree house. Teddy licked his face. I wish we could go homeshouted Annie, pointing at the Pennsylvania book. Jack heard aloud CRA-A-A-ACK The wind started to blow. The tree housestarted to spin. It spun fasterand faster. Then everythingwas still. Absolutely still. Oh, man,whispered Jack. He was lying on the floor ofthe tree house. He was wearing his pajamas and rain poncho again. You okay?Annieasked. Yeah. You?said Jack. Yeah. You?said Jack. My hearts beating really fast,said Annie. Mine, too,said Jack. He thought ofthe Titanicsinking into thecold black sea. His eyes filled with tears. It was terrible, hesaid. Annie nodded. Jack could seetears on hercheeks. Teddy licked Jacks face. Hey,said Jack.Howdid you get out ofmy knapsack? Teddywhined. Jack and Annie stroked his furry head and ears. I think he has a touch of magic,said Annie. Slowly, Jack sat up. He saved our lives, hesaid. And nowwe havethefirst gift to break thespell hes under,said Annie. She turned on her flashlight. She shined it on the silver pocket watch that hung fromher neck. Lucys gift,she const b = said. The watch had stopped. The hands were at Jack was silent. Then hesighed. Thats exactly when theship went down, hesaid. Annielooked at him. I guess thats when timestopped for the Titanic,shesaid. Jack nodded. Annie put the pocket watch on top of Morgans note. A gift fromaship lostatsea,shesaid softly. Theywere both quiet. Then Jack took off his glasses and wiped the tears from his eyes. Annie stood up. She took a deep breath. Im ready to go,she said.Lets put Teddy in your pack and take him home with us. She shined her flashlightaround thetree house. Teddy?she said. There was no sign of the little dog. Hes not here,said Annie. What are you talking about?said Jack.We were just petting him. Hes up to his magic tricks again, said Annie. She sighed. Well have to go home without him. But what happened to him?said Jack. I dont know,said Annie.But I have a feeling well see him again soon.'

Jack pulled on his backpack and climbed down the rope ladder. Annie was waiting for him. Without a word, Jack took her hand. Therain had stopped. But water still dripped fromthetrees. Stars glittered overhead in aclear sky. Silently, Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods. They walked up the dark street to their house and climbed thesteps to their porch. Before they went inside, they looked outagain at the night. Time might have stopped for the Titanic,Jack said. But booksand memories keep the Titanic alive, dont they? Its a true story, but its also like a myth now. Yeah,said Annie.And every time the storys told, we wish it had a different ending. Jack nodded. That was exactly how he felt. Staring at the starry sky, he shuddered at the memory of the sinking ship. He knew that he and Annie werlucky. They had come home. Good night, Titanic, he said softly.Good-bye. Then he and Annie slipped quietly into their house, where it was cozy and dry and very safe. Mom and Dad and Trixie look for Knuffle Bunny.  Dad finds Knuffle Bunny.  Trixie is happy. /Eating Cake My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except I dont like Beatrice. I just like B and thats all. B is my bestest letter. On account of my favorite food starts with that guy. Its name is birthday cake. We had that delicious stuff at school today. Thats because Paulie Allen Puffer turned six years old. And his mother brought chocolate cake and chocolate ice cream and chocolate milk to Room Nine. She is a chocolate nut, I think. The party was very fun. Except for Paulie Allen Puffer got all wound up. And he put cake on his head. And then he laughed till milk came out his nose. That is called nose milk, I told my bestest friend named Lucille. Lucille is a little lady. Eew, she said. I wish I didnt even see that nose milk. Cause now my stomach feels upset. And I cant eat the rest of my cake. Me, too, I said. Now I cant eat the rest of my cake, too. And so I will throw both our cakes in the trash can for us. Then I picked up our cakes. And I hurried up to the trash can. I looked all around me very careful. Then I quick ducked behind the trash can. And I stuffed both those cakes right in my mouth. I rubbed my tummy real happy. Now all I need is some milk to wash it down with, I said. Thats when I saw some milk sitting on a table. All by itself. I picked it up. And drank it all gone. Mmmm, I said. That hit the spot Just then I heard a voice. Junie B. Jones? Why are you out of your seat? It was my teacher. Her name is Mrs. She has another name, too. But I just like Mrs. and thats all. Mrs. has eyes like a hawk. What are you doing over there? she asked me. I am sharing peoples cake and milk, I explained. Except for they arent actually here at the moment. Mrs. rolled her eyes way back in her head. I smiled very sweet. Guess what? When I have my birthday party, I am going to bring cake and milk, too, I said. Plus also I might bring a beanie wienie casserole. Cause that will be a nice change of pace, I think. Just then, I skipped over to Paulie Allen Puffers mother. Excellent cake, madam. My compliments to the chief, I said. Then me and her did a high-five. Only she didnt actually put her hand out. And so mostly I just slapped her on the arm. After that, I skipped back to my seat. Lucille was finishing her chocolate ice cream. She had a chocolate mustache on her lip. I did a frown at her. Lucille, I am surprised at you, I said. You are not eating that ice cream like a little lady. And so I will show you how. Then I quick dipped my spoon into Lucilles ice cream. See? I said. See how I am taking dainty bites of this stuff? Only just then a dainty bite of chocolate ice cream slipped off my spoon. And it plopped into Lucilles lap. She jumped out of her chair. OH NO she hollered.'

const d = 'NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID YOU SPILLED ICE CREAM ON MY BRAND-NEW DRESS AND MY NANNA JUST BROUGHT THIS TO ME FROM NEW YORK CITY AND IT COSTED NINETY-FIVE DOLLARS PLUS TAX Mrs. hurried up to my table. She had a wet sponge to clean Lucilles dress. No Dont said Lucille. You cant put water on this Cause this dress is made of satin And satin is dry clean only Mrs. made angry eyes at me. I did a gulp. Who knew? I said real soft. Then I put my head down on my table. And I covered up with my arms. Cause that is called laying low. And laying low is what you do if you know whats good for you. /Tapping on That Jims Head After the party, me and my other bestest friend rode home on the bus. Her name is Grace. Me and that Grace take turns sitting next to the window. That is good sports of us, I think. Except for sometimes we forget whose turn it is. Then we have to settle it with our fists. This time, it was that Graces turn to sit next to the window. Guess what? I dont even care if you sit there today, I told her. Cause eating all that cake made me in a happy mood. That Grace smiled. Me, too, she said. Eating that cake made me in a happy mood, too. Yeah, only you cant be as happy me I explained. Cause I had two cakes. And you just had one. That Grace did a frown. Thats okay, Grace. Dont be upset, I said. Cause when I have my birthday, I will invite you to my house. And you can have two cakes, too. Oh boy she said. I know it is oh boy, I said back. Plus also you will get your very own paper cup with M&Ms in it. Oooo Yum I love M&Ms, said that Grace. Me too. I love M&Ms, too, I said. On account of the chocolate doesnt melt on your hands. Just the colors melt on your hands and thats all. I smiled real big. And heres another good thing, Grace. When you come to my party, you will get your very own party hat. And we will play Twister. Plus also we will play that game where you shout Bingo. Only I keep on forgetting the name of that one. Just then, a meanie boy named Jim jumped up from his seat. BINGO, stupid he shouted. Its name is BINGO What a MORON Who would even want to come to a stupid party like yours? He made his voice real loud. So everybody could hear. At my house I have cool birthday parties, he said. Like last year my party was named Clowning Around. And we had two clowns from the circus. And they made balloon animals and did magic tricks. I leaned way close to his face. So? I said. I dont even like clowns. Clowns are not normal people. Plus my very own grampa Frank Miller can make balloon animals, too. Except for they all look like wiener dogs. Only hes working on it. That Jim wasnt even listening to me. He just kept on talking about his parties. This year my party is named Old MacDonalds Farm. And a real farmer is bringing a petting zoo right to my front yard. And hes going to bring a lamb, and a goat, and a burro, and some rabbits And hes also bringing a real live pony for us to ride I put my hands on my waist. Yeah, well too bad for you, I said. Cause I saw all about ponies on TV. And ponies buck you off their backs. And then they stomple you into the ground and kill you to death. And so I wouldnt even come to your stupid dumb party in a jillion billion years. Good hollered that Jim. Im glad Cause my birthday is this coming Saturday And tomorrow Im bringing invitations to every single person in Room Nine Only not to you Youre the only one in the whole class Im not bringing an invitation to So there Then he did a big HAH right in my face. And he sat back down in his seat. Meanwhile, I just kept on standing and standing there. Cause something had gone a little bit wrong here, I think. I tapped on his head. Yeah, only heres the thing, I said. I didnt actually know you were having a party on Saturday. And so, good news I think I can make it. No shouted that meanie boy. Youre not coming Now go away I tapped on him again. Yeah, only I was just kidding about the ponies, I said. They hardly even stomple you probably. I dont care Stop bothering me he shouted. I stood on my tippy-toes and looked at his head. Love your hair today, I said. That Jim swatted at me. Get away from me he hollered. Youre not coming to my party And thats final Just then a big lump came in my throat. A big lump is what comes before crying. It hurt to swallow. I sat down and hided my face in my sweater. Darn it, I said. Cause I think I really would have enjoyed myself at that thing. Then my bestest friend named Grace put her arm around me. And she patted me real gentle. And she let me sit next to the window. I walked home from the bus stop very slumping. Very slumping is when your shoulders are sad. And your head cant hold up that good. Grandma Miller was in the nursery. She baby-sits me and my baby brother in the afternoon. His name is Ollie. I love him a real lot. Except I wish he didnt live at my actual house. Grandma Miller was rocking him in the rocking chair. I tried to climb up there, too. Only Grandma said Hold your horses at me. Yeah, only I need to rock very bad, I explained. On account of a mean boy is having a birthday party on Saturday. And he is inviting everyone in Room Nine. Only not me. Im the only one whos not going. Grandma Miller did a sad face. Children can be so cruel, she said. Just wait till I get the baby to sleep. And then you and I will talk about it. Okay? And so thats how come I crossed my arms. And I tapped my foot. And I waited and waited for that baby to go to sleep. Only his eyes kept on staying wide open. Hold them closed with your fingers, Grandma, I told her. Heavens, no she said. Then she kept right on rocking him. And so finally I got tired of waiting. And I went to my room. And I crawled underneath my covers. I crawled way down to the bottom of my sheets. It is very muffly down there. You can say mean stuff. And no one can hear you. Here is all the stuff I hate, I said. First, I hate that meanie Jim. Then I hate clowns. And Old MacDonald had a farmer. Plus I hate rabbits. And burros. And ponies. And guess what else? We didnt actually need a baby at this house. Only no one even consulted me. Just then, I heard a knock on my door. Junie B.? Its Grandma, honey. Ollie finally went to sleep. She came in and lifted up my covers. I called your mother and told her what happened at school, she said. I peeked up at her. And so can she fix it? I asked. Can I go to the birthday party now? Grandma Miller held out her arms to me. She pulled me out of my covers. Your mother is going to talk to you about it when she gets home, she said. Meanwhile, why dont you and I have a little fun. Lets read a book, okay? What kind of story would you like to hear? I thought and thought. I would like to hear a story about a little girl who doesnt get invited to a meanie boys birthday. And so she sneaks to his house. And she lets a wild pony out of the barn. And then it stomples the boy into a flattie pancake. And all the children pour maple syrup on that guy. And they eat him for breakfast. Grandma Miller looked kind of sickish. Youve got to stop worrying about that boys party. Hes just trying to get your goat, she said. Just then my eyes got big and wide at her. Goat? What goat, Grandma? Do I have a goat? Is it a surprise goat? Are you keeping it a secret at your house? I jumped up and pulled her hand. Lets go get it Want to, Grandma? Lets go get my goat right now Just then a great idea popped in my head. HEY I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING, GRANDMA YOU AND ME CAN BRING MY GOAT TO MY HOUSE AND THEN I CAN HAVE MY VERY OWN BIRTHDAY ON SATURDAY I WILL CALL IT COME AND PET MY GOAT AND EVERYONE IN ROOM NINE WILL COME TO MY PARTY AND THEY WONT GO TO THAT MEANIE JIMS All of a sudden, the front door opened. It was Mother I runned to her speedy quick. Mother Mother Guess what? Guess what? Me and Grandma Miller are getting my goat And I am having my very own birthday party on Saturday And all of Room Nine is going to be invited. Only not that Jim I hate He is the only one not coming So ha ha on him Just then, Grandma Miller sneaked out the front door with her sweater. I pulled on Mothers arm. Come on, Mother Come on I said. We have to go to the store and buy my invitations Plus also we have to pick up the beanie wienies Mother didnt come on. She sat down on the couch. And smoothed my hair. Listen to me, Junie B., she said. I know Jim hurt your feelings today. But you cant have your birthday party on Saturday. Your birthday isnt till June, remember? And June is still months away. I know June is months away, I said. And so that is how come I am moving my birthday sooner. Cause months away will be too late.'

const e = 'Mother picked me up and put me on her lap. Im afraid you dont understand, honey, she said. You just cant change the day you were born. No one can. Its impossible. I made my voice very whispering. Yeah, only heres a little secret nobody in Room Nine even knows when my birthday is. So I think we can pull it off. Mother did a little smile. She ruffled my hair. Sorry, honey. No can do, she said. Yes I hollered. Yes can do Cause I have to have my birthday on Saturday Or else I will be the only one who is not going to that meanie Jims And that is the saddest story I ever even heard of. Just then, my eyes got a little bit of wet in them. Mother wiped my face with a tissue. Then she hugged me real tight. And she said the words Im sorry. More bad news. Grandma Miller just called  Theres no goat. /Moving The next morning, I didnt get out of my bed. Not even when Mother hollered, Time for breakfast. She came into my room. Didnt you hear me, Junie B.? Its time to eat, she said. I looked up from my pillow. Yeah, only Im not even hungry. Plus also Im moving today, I said. Mother smiled. She sat on my bed. Youre moving, huh? she asked. And exactly where will you be going? I did my shoulders up and down. Somewhere, I said. Somewhere, where? she asked. Somewhere not here, thats where, I said. Mother hugged me. This is still about Jims birthday party, isnt it? she said. Youre still worried about not getting an invitation. No, Im not, I said. On account of Im not even going to that school anymore. On account of Im moving today. Mother shook her head. Then she went out of my room. And she and Daddy did whispering in the hall. Pretty soon, Daddy came in. He gave me a piggyback ride to the kitchen. Then Mother made my favorite hot cereal. And she let me have all the brown sugar I wanted. She sat down next to me. You know, Junie B., Jim is only doing this to hurt your feelings, she said. He just wants to get a reaction from you, thats all. Sure, he does, said Daddy. And when someone is trying to hurt your feelings, theres only one way to get back at them. You have to pretend you dont care, said Mother. You have to pretend you dont even want to go to that party. Because if you pretend you dont want to go, it will take all the fun out of it for him. Daddy winked. You can do that, cant you? he asked. Youre the best little pretender in the entire world. Just then, my whole face lighted up. Cause that word gave me a great idea Hey I just figured out where I can move to Its called Its a Small World After All. And its at Disneyland Member that, Daddy? Its where all those puppets keep on singing that same song over and over and over again. I smiled. That would be a happy place to live, dont you think? Daddy looked at me a real long time. Then he put his head down on the table. And he started knocking it on the edge. Mother pulled him up from there. They went in the hall and did more whispering. After a while, Mother called to me from her bedroom. Junie B.? Could you pick up the phone, please? Its your grandfather. He wants to talk to you for a minute. I picked up the phone. Hlo? Hello, yourself, little girl, said my grampa Frank Miller. Whatcha up to this morning? Im moving today, I told him. Grampa Miller sounded upset. Moving? he said. Oh no You cant be moving If you move, then you wont be able to come over to my house on Saturday I crinkled up my eyebrows at him. Cause this conversation smelled fishy, thats why. Yeah, only how come you want me to come to your house? I asked. And how come it has to be on Saturday? Because Saturdays the day I do my work around here, remember? he said. Youre still my little helper, arent you? I thought very careful. Yes, I said. On account of sometimes I help Grampa fix stuff. It is called odd jobs, I think. Are you doin odd jobs? I asked him. Is that why you want me to come there? Sure Im doin odd jobs, said my grampa. But I cant do them without my helper, can I? Youre the one who wears the tool belt, arent you? I smiled very proud. Cause Grampa Millers tool belt is the bestest thing I love. It has a jillion tools hanging off of that thing. It wraps around me two whole times. And I dont even cave in. Just then, Grampa Miller made his voice real quiet. You havent even heard the best part yet, he whispered. Guess what Im going to be fixing? I whispered back at him. What? Then Grampa said for me to hang on a minute. On account of he wanted to close his door. Or else my grandma might hear. If your grandma hears, then shell want to be my helper, instead of you, he said. I waited very patient. Ready? he said. Ready, I said. Okay. Im going to be fixing the upstairs toilet. Just then, my mouth came all the way open. Cause fixing the upstairs toilet is a dream come true, thats why Are you gonna take the lid off the top, Grampa? And are you gonna keep flushing it and flushing it? And are you gonna watch all the water go out of that thing? I asked. Sure I am Of course I am Thats half the fun of fixing the toilet Right? he said. Right I said very excited. Plus also I love that big ball that floats on the top. Me, too said my grampa. I love that big ball, too And so I can count on you, cant I? You and I have a date on Saturday, right? I thought some more. Yeah, only I think theres something you forgot, Grampa. What? he asked. What did I forget, little girl? I raised my eyebrows at that sillyhead. You forgot that Im moving today. /Being a Buzzing Bee Grandma and Grampa Miller take turns baby-sitting me before lunch. Then they get me dressed for kindergarten. Except for today, Mother came home from work. And she got me dressed instead. She said she would drive me to school. If I drive you, then you wont have to see Jim on the bus, she said very thoughtful. She got out my clothes for school. It was my jumper with the frogs on it. Yeah, only guess what? Im not even wearing school clothes today. On account of Im moving. And so I have to wear moving man clothes. Mother kept on trying to put that jumper on me. Thats how come I made my legs and arms real stiff. So they wouldnt fit in there that good. Then me and Mother wrestled a teeny bit. And she stood me on my head. And she pulled my tights on me. Youre not moving, Junie B., she said. Youre going to school, and thats final. Running away from your problems never solves anything. Yeah, only Im not even running, I said. Im calling Ryder Rents Trucks. And those guys will drive me. Mother smiled. She tried to hug me. But I kept on staying real stiff. I stayed real stiff all the way in the car to school. Mother parked the car in the parking lot. Then she lifted me out the door. And she carried me real stiff to the playground. She stood me up in the grass. Everything will be fine. Youll see, she said. Just remember what Daddy and I told you. If anyone talks about the party, pretend it doesnt bother you. She kissed me good-bye on my stiff head. Just then, I heard voices hollering. JUNIE B. HEY, JUNIE B. LOOK LOOK WHAT WE GOT they hollered. I turned around. It was my bestest friends, Lucille and that Grace. They were running at me. Look said Lucille. Look what Jim gave us Its invitations to his birthday party on Saturday Its just like he told us, Junie B. said that Grace. Hes really gonna have a petting zoo there I quick covered my ears with my hands. Then I closed my eyes. And I sang a loud song at them. It is called I Cant Hear You, Youre Not Even Botherin Me. I sang it at the top of my lungs. I CAAA-ANNNT HEARRRR YOU I CAAA-ANNNT HEARRRR YOU YOURE NOT E-VEN BOTHERIN MEEEE Then I kept on singing and singing that thing till they went away. Also they did the cuckoo sign at me. After that, I sat down in the grass all by myself. And I looked all around the playground. Lots of other children had invitations, too. Darn it, I whispered. Darn it. Darn it. Darn it. Thats when I saw that meanie Jim. He was giving an invitation to a boy named Crybaby William. Crybaby William is the scarediest cat in Room Nine. He is even scared of a teeny flea, I think. Just then, I sat up a little bit straighter. Cause I just got another idea in my head, thats why It was called, Hey Maybe I can take Williams invitation away from him Cause he wont even chase me, probably And so then I will have my very own invitation And William can get another one from that Jim And then everybody will get to go to the party. Including me'

const f = 'I stood up from the grass. Then I squinted my eyes at Crybaby William. And I started to run at him very slow. I runned faster and faster. Till finally, I was running as fast as a speeding bumblebee. I buzzed all around William zippity quick. His eyes couldnt even follow me that good. Then I buzzed right in his face. And quick I grabbed that invitation out of his fingers I runned my fastest to the swing set And guess what? William didnt even follow me Thats what And heres more good news Williams invitation didnt even have his name on it So that means it can be for anybody, probably Only now its mine I said. Cause I will put my name on it when I get to Room Nine And it will be my very own invitation Just then, the bell rang for school. I put my invitation way down in my deep pocket. And I skipped very happy to my class. Mrs. was standing outside of Room Nine. William was standing with her. His nose was sniffling a real lot. I tried to skip past them. But Mrs. grabbed the straps of my frog jumper. She pulled me back. Yeah, only I dont actually think that is good for the outfit, I said. Mrs. did a frown. Junie B., did you take something that belonged to William? she asked. No, I said. Cause his name wasnt even on it. And so that means it is for anybody, I think. Mrs. tapped her angry foot. Was William holding an invitation, Junie B.? And did you snatch it out of his hands? And then did you run away from him? she asked. I smiled very cute. I was a buzzing bee, I said. Mrs. holded out her hand. May I have it, please? she asked. May I have the invitation you took from William? I rocked back and forth on my feet. Cause I didnt want to give it to her, thats why. Yeah, only I think it mighta bounced out of my pocket, I said. Mrs. bended down next to me. She leaned way into my face. I want that invitation, she said. Now. I did a gulp. Then I quick put my hand in my pocket. Good news. I found it, I said very nervous. Give it to William, said Mrs. Crybaby William put out his hand. I shoved it at him. Here, Mr. Stinkyhead Tattletale Boy, I said. Heres your stinkyhead invitation. Mrs.s eyes got real big. Junie B. Jones Thats quite enough Now you go sit down And I dont want to hear another word. Do you understand, young lady? Not one more word. And so thats how come I walked very slumping to my seat. And so thats how come I walked very slumping to my seat. And I put my head on my table. Cause guess why? Laying low again, thats why. /Daydreaming Mrs. took attendance. Attendance is when you say, Im here. Except if youre not here, you have to be quiet. Also we said, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. That is called opening ceremonies, I think. After that, we sat down. And Mrs. passed out our workbooks. She told us the pages to turn to. It was work about different kinds of shapes. Like circles. And squares. And triankles. I am a breeze at that stuff. Only I couldnt even concentrate very good. On account of I kept daydreaming about that birthday party. Daydreaming is just like night dreaming. Only its not night. And youre not asleep. And youre not dreaming. I kept on thinking about how everybody was going to that party. Only not me. I was the only one. In all of Room Nine. I wish Lucille and Grace werent going, too, I thought to just myself. Cause that would be nice sports of them. After a while, I tapped on Lucille. You are my bestest good friend, I told her. Lucille smiled at me. You are my bestest good friend, too, she said. I touched her new dress. You look very precious today, I said. Lucille fluffed herself. Thank you. You look very precious today, too, she said back. I touched her fingernails with polish on them. I wish you and me could be twins, I said. Me, too. I wish you and me could be twins, too, she said. Just then, my whole face got happy. Lucille Lucille I just thought of something You and me can pretend we are twins And we can do everything just the same And so on Saturday you can come to my house. And I will put nail polish on my nails, just like you And you will stay home from that birthday party, just like me Lucille didnt say anything back. I tapped on her. How come youre not talking, twin? I said. How come youre not saying anything back? Cause I want to go to the party, thats why, said Lucille. I did a huffy breath at her. Yes, Lucille. I know you want to go to the party. But now you and me are twins. And twins have to do everything just the same. And so if I dont go to the party, then you cant go to the party, too. On account of that is the twin rules. No, its not, said Lucille. My cousins are twins. And one is a boy. And one is a girl. And they dont do anything alike. I jumped up from my chair. Yeah, only that is not the kind of twin I want to be, madam I yelled. Mrs. snapped her loud fingers at me. Sit down she hollered. Just then, that Jim I hate turned around in his chair. And he laughed real mean at me. Cause I was in trouble. Turn around your fatty head I said. Only he didnt turn it around. And so thats how come I had to run to his table. And I had to turn it around for him. JUNIE B. JONES shouted Mrs. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I am turning around his fatty head, I explained. Mrs. hurried to where I was. Then she quick took my arm. And she marched me into the hall. She pointed to Principals office. Go she said real angry. I did a gulp. Yeah, only Im not actually supposed to go there anymore, I said. Cause me and Mother had a talk about it. And she said for me not to get sent there again. Mrs.s face got red as a tomato. She started counting numbers. One two three four  And so thats how come I hurried up and walked. Cause teachers who count numbers are the scariest kind there is. /My Story This Time by Junie B. Jones Principal is the boss of the school. He lives at the office. I have to go there when I am unruly. Unruly is the school word for not being ruly. There is a typing lady there. She isnt allowed to smile. Sit down, she said. She pointed at the blue chair. Yeah, only I dont actually like to sit there, remember that? Cause that is where the bad kids sit. And I am not even bad, I explained. I explain that to her every time I go there. The typing lady leaned over the counter at me. She made her face look scary at me. Sittttt dowwwwn, she said. I sat down. Then I pulled my frog jumper over my face. So nobody could see me. Pull your skirt back down, said the typing lady. Yeah, only Im actually allowed to do this. Cause I have on tights, I said. See them? They are green with little tadpoles on them. Just then, I heard Principals voice. Well, well Junie B. Jones. What a surprise, he said. My mouth dropped all the way opened. HEY I hollered from under my dress. HOW DID YOU KNOW ITS ME UNDER HERE? CAUSE YOU CANT EVEN SEE MY FACE Lucky guess, said Principal. After that, I uncovered my head. And me and him went in his office. I climbed up in the big wood chair. Principal looked very tiredish. He rubbed the sides of his baldie head. Okay, lets hear it. Whats your story this time? he said. I sat up straight and tall.'

const g =  'My Story This Time, by Junie B. Jones. Once upon a time, I didnt get invited to a meanie boys birthday. And I am the only one in all of Room Nine who isnt going. And so thats how come I was moving today. Only Mother brought me to school very stiff. And then I was a buzzing bee. Only Crybaby William is a squealer. And Lucille wont be a good twin. And so then Mrs. yelled at me. And thats how come I had to twist that Jims head. And now I am sitting here in this big wood chair. I folded my hands on my lap. The end. Principal put his head down on his desk. I peeked at him. Are you laying low? I whispered. He sat up again. Then he called my mother on the telephone. Those two talk very often. This time, they talked about the birthday party. And how Im not invited. After he hanged up, Principal looked nicer at me. I guess sometimes we grown-ups think were the only ones with problems, he said. We forget that even when youre little, life can be tough. Cant it, Junie B. Jones? Yes, I said. Life can get your goat. After that, me and him went out of his office. And he lifted me into the blue chair again. I want you to wait here a minute, he said. Theres someone I have to talk to before I can get this settled. Yeah, only guess what? I dont actually want to sit in this chair, I explained. On account of this is where the bad kids sit. And Im not even bad. Principal thought and thought. Then he snapped his fingers. I think I might have the perfect solution, he said. He went in his office and brought out a giant shopping bag. What if we hide you under here? he asked. If we hide you under this bag, no one will be able to see you at all. I jumped up and down very excited. Cause hiding is my favorite thing in the whole world, thats why Principal sat me down in the chair. He put that giant shopping bag over my head. HEY WHO TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS? I said. Then I laughed and laughed. Cause that is called comedy, of course. I bended my knees and pulled them under the bag. I hugged them real tight. Now all you can see is the tippy-toes of my shoes I said very happy. This is the perfectest solution I ever saw And so how did you even think of this wonderful thing? I asked. Only Principal didnt answer me back. Cause he probably went back to his office already. After that I hided and hided inside my bag. I hided a real long time. It was a jillion years, I think. Guess what? This is taking longer than a minute, I said from inside there. The typing lady didnt answer me. Yeah, only guess what else? My knees are very bended and squished in here, I said. And so this isnt good for my circlelation, probably. Just then, my legs started squirming all around. Cause I was getting ants in my pants, thats why HEY DOESNT ANYBODY HAVE EARS? GET ME OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW CAUSE I AM AT THE END OF MY ROPE IN THIS THING PLUS ALSO I AM GETTING ANTS IN MY  All of a sudden, someone yanked the bag right off my head. It was the scary typing lady.  pants, I said very soft. She took me back into Principals office. And guess what? That Jim was in there He was sitting in the big wood chair And Principal was frowning at him Junie B., our friend Jim here has something he wants to say to you. Dont you, Jim? asked Principal. That meanie Jim didnt answer. He kept on looking at his feet. Principal tapped his fingers. Were waiting, Jim, he said. Then that Jim did a huffy breath. And he said the words Im sorry. Principal raised up his eyebrows. Sorry for what, Jim? Tell Junie B. what youre sorry for. That Jim stared at his feet some more. Im sorry I didnt give her an invitation to my party, he said very grumpity. But your mother told you to, didnt she, Jim? said Principal. Your mother told you to give an invitation to every single person in your class. But you got mad at Junie B. And you decided not to give her one. Isnt that right? That meanie boy did his shoulders up and down. I guess, he said real soft. Principal crossed his arms. And so what are you going to do to correct the problem? he asked. That Jim waited and waited. Then—all of a sudden—he got down from his chair. And he holded out an invitation to me. My stomach did a flippy flop. For me? Is that really for me I said very squealing. Then I snatched that thing right out of his hand. And I zoomed all around the room. Oh boy I said. Its really for me Its really for me And so now Im not the only one I zoomed all around the big wood chair. Principal looked nervous of me. He hurried up and opened his door. Then I zoomed right out of there And I didnt stop till I got to Room Nine /Ruining My Saturday On Saturday, Mother woke me up from sleeping. We have to go to the store and buy Jim a present, she said. I did a sleepy yawn. Yeah, only I dont actually like that boy, I explained. And so you can go by yourself. And I will trust your judgment. I pulled the covers over my head. Mother pulled them off again. Then she made me get dressed. And she made me eat a banana. And she made me go to the store with her. She holded my hand and pulled me behind her. Since we dont know what he already has, lets get him something unusual, she said. Lets get him greasy, grimy gopher guts. That is unusual, I said. Mother made a sick face. She pulled me through the store. We went past the bathroom stuff. I pointed. That. Lets get him that, I said. That is unusual. Mother sucked in her cheeks. Were not getting him a toilet brush, she said. She pulled me past the pet stuff.'

 const h = 'That. Lets get him that, I said. That is unusual. But Mother said, No choke chain. Just then, she pulled me past the tools. Thats when my eyes popped right out of my head THAT LETS GET HIM THAT LOOK, MOTHER LOOK I LOVE THAT THING I runned to it speedy quick. ITS A TOOL BELT SEE? ITS JUST LIKE GRAMPA MILLERS ONLY ITS MADE FOR LITTLE CHILDREN LIKE ME SEE IT, MOTHER? SEE THIS WONDERFUL THING Mother took it down off the shelf. Look I said. It has a hammer And a screwdriver And some pliers And a flashlight And a real actual level with a bubble in it Plus also, theres a pocket with nails in the front. I jumped all around. Can I try it on? Can I? Please, Mother? Please? Please? Mother shook her head no. Were not shopping for you today, Junie B. Were shopping for Jim, remember? I know it. I know we are shopping for that Jim, I said. And so this can be for his birthday. Only first I have to try it on to see if it fits. Cause him and me are both the same size, I bet Finally, Mother fastened the tool belt on me. Oooo It has Velcro I said. I love this stickery stuff Can we buy it? Please, Mother? Can we buy it? And take it home to my house? Mother thought and thought. I dont know, Junie B. Something tells me this isnt a good idea. Im afraid youll want to keep it. No, I wont I wont want to keep it. I promise, Mother I promise I promise And so finally Mother gave in to me. And she bought the wonderful tool belt. I held it on my lap all the way home in the car. Then I runned into the house. And I zoomed to my room. And I put that thing on me again. Now I can do odd jobs I said real thrilled. I took the hammer and tapped on my wall. Then I screwed a screw with the screwdriver. Plus also, I twisted my Teddys nose off with the pliers. Only I actually didnt mean to do that one. I patted his head. Breathe through your mouth, I said. Just then, Mothers voice hollered to me. JUNIE B. ITS TIME TO TAKE YOUR BATH, HONEY I did a frown. Cause Mother was a little mixed up, I think. I hollered back. YEAH, ONLY I DONT EVEN HAVE TO TAKE A BATH TODAY ON ACCOUNT OF TODAY IS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY IS MY DIRTY DAY Mother came in my room. I know today is Saturday, Junie B., she said. But youre going to a birthday party. And when you go to a birthday party, you have to take a bath. Plus were going to have to wash and curl your hair. I backed up from her. No, I said. Cause nobody even explained that to me before. And so that doesnt even make sense. On account of I hate that meanie kid. So how come I have to get clean for him? Mother looked at the end of her rope. When you go to a party, you take a bath. Period. End of discussion, she said. Then she left my room. And she went to start the tub. I sat on my bed very glum. Darn it, I said. Cause that stupid boy is ruining my whole entire Saturday. Mother hollered some more. JUNIE B.? COULD YOU BRING ME THE TOOL BELT, PLEASE? I NEED TO GET IT WRAPPED Darn it, I said again. Cause I didnt even want to give that to him. I looked down at it. I touched all the wonderful tools. I love this darned thing, I said real sad. IM WAITING shouted Mother. But I still didnt take it to her. Just then, I heard the bath water turn off. My heart got very pumpy. Oh no I said. Cause now shes gonna come get me And she will take my tool belt away And she will wrap it up for that meanie guy I jumped off my bed and runned around my room. I gotta hide I gotta hide I runned all over everywhere. Darn it Cause theres not even a good hiding place in this dumb room I said. JUNIE B. Mother screamed. I heard her feet They were coming for me, I think Oh no I said. Oh no Oh no Then all of a sudden, I quick grabbed my wonderful tool belt And I zoomed to my door And I nailed that thing shut with my hammer /The Only One in Room Nine Mother runned into my room. She pushed right through my nails. JUNIE B. JONES WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? she shouted. She looked at my door. Her eyes got very bulging. YOU WERE HAMMERING? she yelled. YOU WERE HAMMERING NAILS??? IN YOUR DOOR? Just then Daddy runned in, too. WHERE IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET A HAMMER? he yelled. Tell him, Junie B. Tell your father where you got the hammer growled Mother. I pointed at her. She gave it to me, I said. Just then, steam came out of Mothers head. NO I DID NOT GIVE YOU THAT HAMMER, JUNIE B. THAT HAMMER WAS FOR JIM AND YOU KNOW IT After that, Mother picked me up. And she sat me on my bed. And she growled more mad words at me. They were I cannot be trusted to have a real actual hammer. And I cannot be trusted to have a real actual tool belt. And I am never ever allowed to have nails until I am all grown up and I live in my own apartment. Daddy walked up and down in front of me.'

 const hi = 'Why, Junie B.? Why would you do such a thing? Why would you ever nail your door shut? he said. I started to cry a little bit. Because, I said. Because why? he grouched. Because I felt pressure inside me, I said. Because that party is ruining my whole entire Saturday. Because first I had to shop. And then Mother said I had to get a bath and wash my hair. Only I dont even like that meanie head boy. And so how come I have to get clean and give him that wonderful tool belt? Cause what kind of deal is that? Mother did an angry breath. This was your decision, Junie B., she said. Youre the one who wanted to go to the party. No one is making you do it. I wiped my nose on my sweater sleeve. Yeah, only if I dont go, I will be the only one in Room Nine, I said. And that is the saddest story I ever heard of. Daddy sat down next to me. Why? he said. Why is it sad to spend your Saturday the way you want to spend it? Why is it sad to spend the day having fun, instead of wasting it on a boy you dont like? Mother sat down, too. That doesnt sound sad to me, said Mother. That sounds good, in fact. No, that does not sound good, I said very snapping. What is so good about being the only one? Daddy did his shoulders up and down. Lots of things, he said. Like youll be the only one who doesnt have to take a bath. Have you ever thought of that? And youll be the only one who doesnt have to wash her hair, said Mother. And, said Daddy, youll be the only one in Room Nine who doesnt have to give Jim a present. How bout that one? Huh? I sat up a little bit straighter. Cause that one was excellent, thats why. Mother ruffled my hair. And what about Grampa Miller? she asked. You havent forgotten that he invited you to his house today, have you? Just then, my whole mouth came open. Cause I did forget about that The toilet I said. I forgot about the toilet Cause me and Grampa were going to fix that thing And we were going to touch that big ball that floats on top Mother made a face. Lovely, she said. I know it is lovely, I said. And so I have to get over there right now. Or else Grandma is gonna get to touch it, and not me. Then Mother looked at me very strange. And Daddy went to get his keys. Mother and Daddy made me take the tool belt back to the store. They made me give it to the man. Here, I said. I cannot be'

const j = 'trusted with this wonderful thing. The man smiled kind of sad. Sorry, sis, he said. Thats okay, I said. Cause the nails didnt actually work that good. He gave me my money back. Maybe when youre older, he said. Maybe, I said. Plus also I might get a toilet brush. After the store, I went to my Grampa Millers. He was working in his garden. I ran my fastest at him. GRAMPA MILLER HEY, GRAMPA MILLER DID YOU FIX IT YET? DID YOU ALREADY FIX THE TOILET? He twirled me around. Not yet he said. Not yet I didnt Ive been waitin for you And so just then, me and him hurried up. And we got our tools. And runned upstairs. Then we took the lid right off that thing And I flushed all the water right out of it And I touched the big ball This is fun Right, Grampa? Right? This is the time of our life I said. Sure it is Of course it is said my grampa Frank Miller. I laughed very happy. Hey, Grampa. Guess what? I am the only one I said. He looked confused at me. I am the only one in Room Nine who is fixin a toilet I explained. Then Grampa Miller laughed, too. Youre really somethin, he said. Youre really somethin, too, Grampa, I said back. Then I hugged him real tight. And I climbed up on his lap. And I told him a secret in his ear. And guess what else? I whispered. I still would like a goat. My name is Junie B. Jones. The B stands for Beatrice. Except I dont like Beatrice. I just like B and thats all. I go to school in Room Nine. Room Nine is where they have afternoon kindergarten. Also they have morning kindergarten. Only I am not familiar with that arrangement. Today at school, my teacher had a nouncement to make. A nouncement is the school word for listen to me and I MEAN it. My teachers name is Mrs. She has another name, too. But I just like Mrs. and thats all. Mrs. told us that we are going to have a special day in Room Nine. And it is called Valentimes Day. She said that valentimes are special cards about friendship. And all of us in Room Nine are going to give them to each other My bestest friend Lucille squealed real happy. Oooo I love getting cards, Teacher she said. I especially love getting the kind with money in them. Money is my favorite kind of mail Me, too, Lucille I said. Money is my favorite kind of mail, too. Plus also I enjoy the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. Mrs. did a chuckle. Well, Im sorry, girls. But Im afraid there wont be money in our valentines, she said. In Room Nine we will just be sending happy wishes to each other. But it will still be lots of fun. She smiled. We will be making a special valentines box to hold all the cards. And on the day of our party, I will personally deliver the cards to each one of you, she explained. Just then, I jumped right out of my chair. Cause nobody even mentioned a party before Hurray I yelled. Hurray for parties Can we have cake and doughnuts, Mrs.? And what about cheese popcorn and cotton candy and pretzels and candy apples? I thought some more. Plus also well need red licorice and peanut butter cups, probably. And chocolatecovered raisins. Oh yeah, and malted milk balls AND GUMMI BEARS I looked over at her. Maybe you should be writing this down, I said. Mrs. shook her head no. She said we would have cupcakes, punch, and candy hearts. I sat back down very disappointed. Cause not much thought went into the menu, thats why. Lucille stood up. What kind of punch, Teacher? she asked. Will it have fresh raspberries and strawberries floating in it? My nannas caterer always puts fresh raspberries and strawberries into our punch. And it is delicious. After that, Lucille twirled around in her fluffy dress. And what about dancing? I am learning ballroom dancing at my expensive dancing school. And so I would be happy to teach the children who are cheaper than me. Mrs. stared at Lucille a real long time. How very generous of you, she said finally. But I dont think well be having ballroom dancing, Lucille. Jamal Hall waved his hand in the air. Then what about a puppet show? he asked. If we cant have dancing, can we have a puppet show? Yes, said a girl named Lynnie. Or else maybe we could hire a magician. Or what about a wild animal act? asked a boy named Roger. Like a grizzly bear or a sea lion? Just then, a boy named Paulie Allen Puffer ran right to the front of the room. And he jumped up and down all over the place. NO WAIT IVE GOT IT IVE GOT IT he shouted real excited. WE COULD GET SOME OF THOSE JUGGLERS WHO JUGGLE CHAIN SAWS After that, Room Nine clapped and whistled and hooted and hollered. Cause who doesnt love chain-saw jugglers? Thats what I would like to know After we finished clapping, we looked at Mrs. Her head was on her desk. And her eyes were staring out the door. Then all of the children in Room Nine got very quiet. Cause Mrs. was scaring us a little bit. Plus also we were out of party ideas. /Scribble Scraps The next day, me and my bestest friend named Grace were playing on the playground. And guess what? We saw Mrs. carry a giant box into Room Nine It was the box we were going to decorate for Valentimes Day, I think Wowie wow wow That thing will hold a million bajillion Valentimes cards I said real thrilled. That Grace did a frown at me. Stop saying valentime, Junie B., she said. You keep on saying valentime with an m sound. And you are supposed to say valentine with an n sound. I did a frown back at her. Who said so? I asked.'

const k = 'I said so, said that Grace. Didnt you hear my voice? I just got finished telling you it has an n in it. The word is valentine. I did a huffy breath at that girl. You are not the boss of my words, Grace, I said. This is a freed country. And if I want to say valentime, I can. And I will not even go to jail. That Grace looked annoyed at me. I didnt say you would go to jail, Junie B., she said. I just wish you would say the word correctly, thats all. Yeah well, we cant always have what we wish for, Grace, I told her. I wish valentime had an m in it. But it doesnt, does it? After that, me and that Grace made squinty eyes at each other. Plus also we crossed our arms. And we tapped our angry feet. Only pretty soon we got tired of that. Cause fighting with your friends is not that fun. Thats how come both of us hugged each other. And we said a pology. Sorry, Junie B., said Grace. Sorry I tried to be the boss of your words. Sorry, Grace, I said back. Sorry valentime doesnt have an m in it. After that, both of us holded hands. And we skipped all the way to Room Nine. That is called a victory skip. And guess what else? After we got to Room Nine, Mrs. said it was time to decorate the valentimes box Everybody quick sat down in their seats. Then we watched Mrs. cover the box with shiny white paper. Plus also she cut a mail slot in the top. After that, all of the children got our scissors. And we cut out paper hearts to paste onto the sides. I cut my fastest. Mrs. Look Look I said. I am already done cutting my heart And so I have the fastest scissors in Room Nine, probably Just then, a meanie boy named Jim jumped up from his chair. No, you dont Look over here I already cut two hearts See? One two So ha ha on you he said. I quick cut another heart. Yeah, well now I have two, too And so you are not the winner anymore, Meanie Jim Jim held up one more. Three he yelled. I just cut number three So I am still one ahead of you I made my scissors go speedy fast. Ha Now I have three, too. So there I said. Jim did a fast snip. Four Im up to four he said. Thats how come I got fusstration inside me. STOP IT, JIM STOP CUTTING SO FAST AND I MEAN IT After that, I tried to cut one more heart. But my scissors went very out of control. And my heart turned out like scribble scraps DARN IT NOW LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO I hollered real mad. All of a sudden, a big hand came flying over the top of my head. And it snatched my scissors right off my fingers. I bended my head back to see who it was. It was Mrs. I did a gulp. I was afraid it was you, I said kind of soft. Then Mrs. went to Jims table. And she snatched his scissors, too. And so me and him had to sit in our chairs for the rest of the day. And we didnt get to decorate the valentimes box. Cause our cutting days were over, thats why. And our pasting days never even got started. /Picking Out Valentimes The valentimes box turned out very beautiful After it was finished, Mrs. passed out lists for us to take home. The lists had the names of all the children in Room Nine. There are eighteen children in our class, said Mrs. So that means that everyone needs to bring eighteen valentines. I raised my hand. Do we bring valentimes for ourselves, too? I asked her. Well, no, she said. I mean theres no rule against it, I suppose. But valentines are really supposed to be given to others. She thought for a second. Oops. I guess that means I made a mistake, doesnt it? she said. Since you wont be bringing in cards for yourselves, you will only need to bring in seventeen valentines. I raised up my hand again. Yeah, only what if we also want to bring a valentime for you, Mrs.? I asked. Mrs. raised up her eyebrows. Well, then you would be back up to eighteen again. Wouldnt you? she said. Seventeen plus one equals eighteen. I tapped on my chin. Yeah, only what if theres people in here who we dont actually like that much? Do we have to bring them a valentime, too? Yes, Junie B., she said. Of course you do. Valentines Day is a day of friendship for everyone. So every single boy and girl in Room Nine will bring a card for every other boy and girl. After Mrs. finished explaining, she sat back down at her desk. I zoomed up there and whispered in her ear. Yeah, only I know I have to bring cards to the regular boys and girls, I said real soft. But I dont have to bring cards to the big, fat stinky heads, do I? All of a sudden, Mrs. throwed her arms in the air. Yes, Junie B. Yes, you do she said. For the last time you will bring a card for everyone in Room Nine. Even the big, fat stinky heads Just then, all of Room Nine looked at her. Cause teachers are not supposed to say big, fat stinky heads, I think. After that, Mrs. closed her eyes for a real long time. Then finally, she stood up very slow. And she went to the sink. And she took aspirin. The next day was Saturday. And it was the funnest Saturday ever Cause Daddy took me to the drugstore And he bought me beautiful heart antennas for my head Plus also he let me pick out my very own box of valentimes After we got home, Mother helped me pick out the perfect cards for every person in Room Nine. First, I picked a card for my bestest friend Lucille. It had a lovely princess on the front of it. This one, Mother I said.'

const l = 'I will give Lucille this one Cause when she grows up, she is going to marry an expensive prince And she is going to let me and Grace sweep her castle Plus also we will get to wear her raggedy used-up gowns Mother looked and looked at me. Lucille is a regular saint, she said very quiet. I know it, I said. Me and Grace are lucky to have her. After that, I found the perfect card for Grace, too. It had two running shoes on the front of it Mother read me the words. It said, Valentine You and I make the perfect pair We do, Mother Me and that Grace do make the perfect pair Cause Grace can beat me at running And I can beat Grace at lots of other stuff, probably Only I havent actually found anything yet. After that, I picked out special cards for all of the other children in Room Nine. Every time I picked out a valentime, Mother crossed a name off the list. Finally, there was only one name left. Jim, said Mother. You still need to pick a card for Jim. I did a big sigh. Cause I didnt want to give that guy one, of course. I looked all through my box of valentimes. Then, all of a sudden, I saw a card with a funny skunk on the front. That one, I said. I will send Jim that one. Mother shook her head. I dont know, Junie B., she said. A picture of a skunk just doesnt seem very nice. I put it in an envelope. Perfect, I said. Cause neither is Jim. /The Disagreedment On Monday I skipped into Room Nine very thrilled. Mrs. Mrs. Look I said. I have all my valentimes for the big, giant valentimes box They are right here in this paper bag I am carrying I runned and showed her inside it. See them? See them, Mrs.? I matched every single card to the exact person who will get it I explained. Mrs. patted my head. She said the word good job. Then she took me by my hand. And she showed me how to put my valentimes through the mail slot in the box. I do believe that you are the very first person in Room Nine to bring in her cards, said Mrs. I did a gasp at that exciting news First, Mrs.? I asked. I am really, really first? After that, I springed way high in the air. And I ran around and around in a circle. Ive never been first at anything before I said real squealy. Not ever, ever never And so what is my prize for winning? I closed my eyes and held out my hands. Put it right in my hands, okay, Mrs.? I wont even peek. promise After that, I stood there real patient. But nothing got put in my hands. Finally, Mrs. bended down next to my ear. Junie B., honey, Im really sorry. But there is no prize, she said. We werent actually having a contest. I opened my eyes. We werent? I asked. Mrs. shook her head no. My shoulders slumped a teeny bit. So then, a prize would be out of the question, probably, I said. Mrs. shrugged. Im afraid I didnt buy any prizes, she said. After that, I rocked back and forth on my feet. And I thought and thought. Would you have a mint in your drawer, maybe? Or some stickers? I asked. Mrs. smiled. Then she took me to her desk. And we looked in her drawer. How about a broken piece of chalk and a yellow rubber band? she asked. Sold I said. After that, Mrs. told me congratulations. And she gave me my prizes. I quick skipped to my table to show them to Lucille. She wrinkled up her nose. Yuck. Have you been going through the trash can again? she asked. No, silly These are my prizes I said. I got prizes for bringing in my valentimes first Lucille smoothed her dress. Yes, well, I would have brought my cards in today, too. But theyre not back from the printers yet, she told me. What? I said. What printers? The printers where they print my name on the cards, she said. Wait till you see them, Junie B. Every card will have Love and kisses from Lucille on the bottom of it She hugged herself. They are so beautiful, she said. Each valentine has a cherry lollipop on the front. And the lollipop is in the shape of Cupid. She sighed very dreamy. Cupid is the symbol of Valentines Day, you know, she said. Of course I know, I said back. Plus also skunks and shoes are symbols of Valentimes Day, too. Cause thats what are on my cards. After that, me and Lucille did our work till recess. Then both of us went outside to play with our other bestest friend, Grace. Only too bad for us. Cause Lucille kept on bragging about Valentimes Day. And thats how come she and that Grace got into a disagreedment. I am going to get more valentines than anyone, bragged Lucille. Thats because the boys love me better than any other girl. And they will bring me lots and lots of cards. Grace looked curious at her. But Mrs. said to only bring one card for every boy and girl, remember? Not lots and lots. Lucille flounced her flouncy dress. Silly Grace. Look at me, for goodness sake I am precious And when youre precious, boys automatically bring you lots of valentines. They just cant help theirselves. She twirled all around. I am the cutest girl in Room Nine, Grace, she said. I am way cuter than anyone else. She giggled and pointed. Even you. After that, Grace did a little frown. Cause that hurt her feelings, I think. I tapped on Lucille. Yeah, only Grace is the nicest, Lucille, I said. And so maybe the boys will bring her lots of valentimes, too. Lucille did a huffy breath at me. But Im richer than Grace, Junie B. So that is another reason to bring me more, she said. I thought for a minute. Yes, but Grace can run faster, I said. So? said Lucille. My hair is longer. And boys like long hair. I looked at Graces head. But Graces hair is springier and curlier, I said. And that is cute as a button. Lucille made squinty eyes at me. But I have a big-screen TV. And a pool she said real loud. Thats how come me and that Grace leaned our heads together. And we got in a huggle. Finally, I looked up at Lucille. Okay. Heres what we came up with, I said. Grace can whistle through her teeth. Plus she can wiggle her ears. And also, she can dribble a basketball through her legs while shes running. Lucille jumped up and down. BUT I HAVE A PONY she hollered. I patted her very sympathetic. Sorry, I said real soft. Grace has a snake. After that, Lucilles shoulders got very sagging. And she sat down in the grass. Cause boys love snakes better than anything. Pretty soon, that Grace sat down next to Lucille. And she put her arm around Lucilles shoulders. And she patted her. Cause guess what else? Grace is a good sport. /Valentimes Time Valentimes Day came on Friday And guess what? My grandma Helen Miller bought me a special Valentimes outfit And it matched my heart antennas very perfect That day at school, I skipped all around Room Nine. Cause I was a treat for the eyes, I tell you Finally, I sat in my seat. And Mrs. took attendance. And guess what? Nobody was absent Cause who wants to miss a party, thats why After attendance, Mrs. put on a special Valentimes apron. It had a big heart pocket in the front. Then Mrs. filled the heart pocket with Valentimes cards from the box. And she delivered them to all of the children. And wait till you hear this The very first valentime was delivered to me To Junie B. Jones And it said my name right on the envelope YAHOO I shouted real thrilled. I AM FIRST AGAIN, MRS. YAHOO YAHOO After that, Mrs. kept on delivering cards until the whole valentimes box was empty. Then all of us got to open up our cards. And it was as fun as a birthday party, I tell you After Lucille finished opening her valentimes, she called Grace to our table. Come here, Grace Come here and bring your valentines Then you and I can count our cards. And well see who got the most from the boys, she said. Grace came over.'

const m =  'She smiled kind of nervous. Well okay. Here goes, she said. Then Grace put all of her valentimes in front of me and Lucille. And she counted them one by one. Pretty soon, Grace wasnt smiling anymore. Rats. I knew I shouldnt have come over here, she said. Lucille grinned a teeny bit. Why, Grace? she asked. How many did you get? You have to tell me, Grace. How many? Grace did a big sigh. I only got seventeen, she said. I only got one card from every person. And thats all. No extras. Lucilles face lighted up very bright. She flipped her hair all around in the air. Gee, I am sorry to hear that, Grace, she said. Well, I suppose I should count mine now. After that, Lucille counted her cards in front of me and Grace. She counted them right out loud. Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen  All of a sudden, Lucille stopped counting. Cause there was only one more valentime left in her pile, thats why. She quick stood up at her seat. And looked all around herself. First, she looked under the table. Then she looked on top of her chair. And all over the floor. Also she looked in her pockets. And her backpack. And her purse. Finally, she sat back down real upset. I dont understand, she said. How could this be happening? Every day my nanna tells me how special I am. But seventeen valentines isnt special at all. Seventeen valentines is just the same as everybody else. I did a sigh. Nannas, I said. You cant believe a word they say. Grace looked cheerier. Count yours, Junie B. Count your valentines and see if you got seventeen like Lucille and me. Of course I got seventeen, silly Grace, I told her. Everybody in this whole room got seventeen. It was the rule, remember? After that, I put all my cards in a pile. And I counted them out loud, just like Lucille. I did a frown. Then I counted them again. And even again. Cause guess what? Somebody broke the rule, thats what I springed up on my chair. ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE WHO DIDNT SEND ME A VALENTIME? AND DO NOT TRY TO DENY IT BECAUSE IVE ONLY GOT SIXTEEN CARDS IN MY PILE I pointed my finger at Meanie Jim. WAS IT YOU, MISTER? HUH? ARE YOU THE MEANIE HEAD WHO DIDNT SEND ME ONE? I looked all around. OR MAYBE IT WAS YOU, MR. PAULIE ALLEN PUFFER  OR YOU, CHARLOTTE WHO-I-DONT-ACTUALLY-KNOW-YOUR-LAST-NAME  OR YOU, ROGER  OR— Just then, Mrs. swooped me off my chair. Do not stand on your chair, Junie B. she said. And please dont fight about valentines. If someone didnt send you a card, it was just a mistake. No one would do something like that on purpose. Im sure of it. After that, I sat back down in my seat. And I looked at that woman very curious. Because Mrs. is a nice teacher. But sometimes she doesnt understand children at all. /Bingo I put my head down on my table. Cause I needed to figure out who didnt send me a valentime, thats why. I thinked and thinked real hard. Then, all of a sudden, I springed up. Lucille I thinked of a plan I thinked of how to find that guy All I have to do is see the names of who signed my valentimes Cause whoever is missing is the person who didnt send me one Lucille looked admiring at me. That is very smart of you, Junie B., she said. You should be on Cops. I know it, I said back. My head is as sharp as a tack. After that, I got all of my valentimes in a pile. And me and Lucille looked at the people who signed them. We kept track of their names very good. Only too bad for me. Cause seven of my valentimes werent even signed Darn it, I said. Now what am I supposed to do? Just then, I saw Mrs. hurrying to my table again. Junie B.? I have some good news for you she said. Guess what I just found in the bottom of the valentines box? I sat up real quick.'

const n = 'Cause guessing games are my favorites, of course. A meatball, I said. Mrs. did a frown. No, Junie B. Why would there be a meatball in the box? Think about it. What have people been putting in the valentines box all week? Valentimes cards, I said real smart. Right, she said. And how many valentines did you get today? Sixteen, I told her. Yes, she said. You were missing one, werent you? And so what do you think I found in the bottom of the box just now? This time I thought my hardest. A meatball, I said. Mrs. rolled her eyes up at the ceiling. Then I looked up there, too. But I didnt see anything. Finally, Mrs. pulled a giant envelope from behind her back. No, this, Junie B., she said. This is what I found in the bottom of the box. I found this big envelope. And its addressed to you My mouth came open very shocked. Then all of a sudden, I clapped my hands very thrilled. HEY WAIT A SECOND HERE MAYBE THIS COULD BE MY MISSING VALENTIME Mrs. looked funny at me. Bingo, she said kind of soft. YES I shouted. BINGO BINGO BINGO After that, I jumped up and down. And I danced all around. Cause nobody broke the rule after all And that was very nice of them After I finished dancing, I opened up the envelope. And it was the beautifullest card I ever saw It had lace and hearts all over the front And a purple ribbon was weaved all around the edge Look, Mrs. Look Look Its a mushy gushy kind I said. I always wanted one of these things Who sent it? Huh? Read me their name, okay? Who sent it? Who sent it? Mrs. opened up the card and looked at the name. Then she laughed out loud. Well, well, well it looks like youve got yourself a fan, she said. She ruffled my hair. This card is signed, From Your Secret Admirer. I raised up my eyebrows. Huh? What? Who? Mrs. smiled. A secret admirer is someone who likes you very much, but hes too shy to tell you, she explained. I guess your Valentines Day turned out pretty good after all, huh? she said. Yes My Valentimes Day turned out almost perfect I said. Now all I have to do is figure out who my secret admirer is, and I will be in business After that, I put my head on my table. And I closed my eyes. Cause I needed to think of another plan, of course /Wink, Wink Another plan did not come easy. I thinked and thinked for a real long time. Finally, I tapped on my bestest friend Lucille. Want to help me, Lucille? I asked. Want to help me figure out my secret admirer? Lucille did mad eyes at me. Just because you have a secret admirer doesnt mean youre prettier than me, she said very annoyed. I looked surprised at her. I never said I was prettier, Lucille, I said. Its just that someone in Room Nine loves me better than he loves you. And I keep on wondering who it is. Lucille leaned close to my face. Its a cuckoo head boy, thats who it is, she said. After that, she scooted her chair to the end of the table. And she turned her head away from me. I did a mad breath at that girl. Keep acting like that, and youll be sweeping your own castle, I said. After that, I looked all around Room Nine. And guess who I saw? I saw Crybaby William, thats who Crybaby William sits right behind me. And is the shyest guy I ever heard of. And so maybe he might be my secret admirer I spinned around in my chair and waved at him. Hello, shy boy, I said real cute. William looked nervous of me. What do you want? he said. I wrinkled up my nose very darling. Yeah, only you dont even have to be shy of me anymore, William. Cause I think I know your secret, I said. After that, I put my chin on his table. And I winked my eye at him. Only Im not actually good at winking.'

const p = 'And so I have to say the words. Wink, wink, William, I said. Wink, wink, wink. See my eye? See how it is trying to wink at you? Williams face started to sweat. Turn around, please, he said. I did a giggle. Cause that admirer boy was shyer than I thought. You are a silly sausage, William, I said. Then I tried to tickle him under his chin. But William swatted my hand away. I tapped my fingers on the table. Okay. Heres the thing, William. Swatting my hand is not actually that admiring. And so please do not do that again. After that, I tried to tickle his chin again. But this time, he ducked under the table. I did a frown. Cause something did not seem right here. Finally, I bended my head down and I peeked at him. Im going to take a wild guess here, William. Youre not actually my secret admirer, are you? I asked. No said William. No, no, no After that, I did a big sigh. And I turned my chair back to my own table. I looked all around Room Nine again. And guess what boy I saw next? I saw Paulie Allen Puffer, thats who And he is always teasing me And so maybe he is my secret admirer I zoomed to his table speedy fast. Wink, wink, Paulie Allen Puffer, I said. Wink, wink, wink. Whats wrong with your eye? he said. I puckered up my lips. And I blowed that guy a kiss. Thank you for the beautiful valentime, Paul, I said. Paulie Allen Puffer looked strange at me. Paul? Whos Paul? What beautiful valentine? My valentine was the one with the oozy slime monster on the front, he said. Dont you remember it? Just then, I made a face. Cause I remembered it, of course. I hurried up back to my seat again. Thats when I saw a boy named Ham. And Ham hardly even knows me. And so he was worth a try, I think. I quick went to his table. Okay, Ham. Im running out of patience here. So listen very careful. I faced my eyeball at him. Wink, wink, okay? Now are you my secret admirer or not? And please tell me the truth. Or you will be sorry. Ham sticked out his tongue at me. Also he put his thumbs in his ears. And he flapped his hands up and down. All rightie, I said. Im going to take that a no. After that, I went back to my table. And I sat down real fusstrated. I put my head in my hands very glum. Cause guess what? Finding a secret admirer is not  easy sounds. Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see?

 const t = 'Mom pointed excitedly out the car window. Look A cow My brother, Elliot, and I both groaned. We had been driving through farmland for four hours, and Mom had pointed out every single cow and horse. Look out your side, Wendy Mom cried from the front seat. Sheep I stared out the window and saw about a dozen gray sheep—fat, woolly ones— grazing on a grassy green hill. Nice sheep, Mom, I said, rolling my eyes. Theres a cow Elliot exclaimed. Now he was doing it I reached across the backseat and gave him a hard shove. Mom, is it possible to explode from boredom? I moaned. BOOOOOOM Elliot shouted. The kid is a riot, isnt he? I told you, Dad muttered to Mom. A twelve-year-old is too old to go on a long car trip. So is an eleven-year-old Elliot protested. Im twelve. Elliot is eleven. How can you two be bored? Mom asked. Look—horses Dad sped up to pass a huge yellow truck. The road curved through high, sloping hills. In the far distance, I could see gray mountains, rising up in a heavy mist. Theres so much beautiful scenery to admire, Mom gushed. After a while, it all looks like some boring old calendar, I complained. Elliot pointed out of his window. Look No horses He doubled over, laughing. He thought that was the funniest thing anyone had ever said. Elliot really cracks himself up. Mom turned in the front seat. She narrowed her eyes at my brother. Are you making fun of me? she demanded. Yes Elliot replied. Of course not, I chimed in. Who would ever make fun of you, Mom? When do you ever stop? Mom complained. Were leaving Idaho, Dad announced. Thats Wyoming up ahead. Well be up in those mountains soon. Maybe well see Mountain Cows I exclaimed sarcastically. Elliot laughed. Mom sighed. Go ahead. Ruin our first family vacation in three years. We hit a bump. I heard the trailer bounce behind us. Dad had hooked one of those big, old-fashioned trailers to the back of our car. We had dragged it all over the West.  The trailer was actually kind of fun. It had four narrow beds built into the sides. And it had a table we could sit around to eat or play cards. It even had a small kitchen. At night, wed pull into a trailer camp. Dad would hook the trailer up to water and electricity. And we spent the night inside, in our own private little house. We hit another bump. I heard the trailer bounce behind us again. The car lurched forward as we started to climb into the mountains. Mom, how do I know if Im getting carsick or not? Elliot asked. Mom turned back to us, frowning. Elliot, you never get carsick, she said in a low voice. Did you forget? Oh. Right, Elliot replied. I just thought it might be something to do. Elliot Mom screamed. If youre so bored, take a nap Thats boring, my brother muttered. I could see Moms face turning an angry red. Mom doesnt look like Dad, Elliot, and me. She is blond and has blue eyes and very fair skin, which turns red very easily. And shes kind of plump. My dad, brother, and I are skinny and sort of dark. The three of us have brown hair and brown eyes. You kids dont know how lucky you are, Dad said. Youre getting to see some amazing sights. Bobby Harrison got to go to baseball camp, Elliot grumbled. And Jay Thurman went to sleepaway camp for eight weeks I wanted to go to sleepaway camp, too I protested. Youll go to camp next summer, Mom replied sharply. This is the chance of a lifetime But the chance of a lifetime is so boring Elliot complained. Wendy, entertain your brother, Dad ordered. Excuse me? I cried. How am I supposed to entertain him? Play Car Geography, Mom suggested. Oh, no Not again Elliot wailed. Go ahead. Ill start, Mom said. Atlanta. Atlanta ends with an A. So I had to think of a city that starts with an A. Albany, I said. Your turn, Elliot. Hmmmmm. A city that starts with a Y  My brother thought for a moment. Then he twisted up his face. I quit My brother is such a bad sport. He takes games too seriously, and he really hates to lose. Sometimes he gets so intense when hes playing soccer or softball, I really worry about him. Sometimes when he thinks he cant win, he just quits. Like now. What about Youngstown? Mom asked. What about it? Elliot grumbled. I have an idea I said. How about letting Elliot and me ride in the trailer for a while? Yeah Cool Elliot cried.  I dont think so, Mom replied. She turned to Dad. Its against the law to ride in a trailer, isnt it? I dont know, Dad said, slowing the car. We were climbing through thick pine woods now. The air smelled so fresh and sweet. Let us Elliot pleaded. Come on—let us I dont see any harm in letting them ride back there for a while, Dad told Mom. As long as theyre careful. Well be careful Elliot promised. Are you sure its safe? Mom asked Dad. Dad nodded. What could happen? He pulled the car to the side of the highway. Elliot and I slid out. We ran to the trailer, pulled open the door, and hurried inside. A few seconds later, the car pulled back onto the highway. We bounced along behind it in the big trailer. This is so cool Elliot declared, making his way to the back window. Do I have good ideas or what? I asked, following him. He slapped me a high five. We stared out the back window. The highway seemed to tilt down as we headed up to the mountains. The trailer bounced and swayed as the car tugged it. The road tilted up steeper. And steeper. And thats when all our troubles began. I win Elliot cried. He jumped up and raised both fists in triumph. Three out of five I demanded, rubbing my wrist. Come on—three out of five. Unless youre chicken. I knew that would get him. Elliot cant stand to be called a chicken. He settled back in the seat. We leaned over the narrow table and clasped hands. We had been arm wrestling for about ten minutes. It was kind of fun because the table bounced every time the trailer rolled over a bump in the road. I am as strong as Elliot. But hes more determined. A lot more determined. You never saw anyone groan and sweat and strain so much in arm wrestling To me, a game is just a game. But to Elliot, every game is life or death. He had won two out of three about five times. My wrist was sore, and my hand ached. But I really wanted to beat him in this final match. I leaned over the table and squeezed his hand harder. I gritted my teeth and stared menacingly into his dark brown eyes. Go he cried. We both strained against each other. I pushed hard. Elliots hand started to bend back. I pushed harder. I nearly had him. Just a little harder. He let out a groan and pushed back. He shut his eyes. His face turned beet-red. I could see the veins push out at the sides of his neck. My brother just cant stand to lose. SLAM The back of my hand hit the table hard. Elliot had won again. Actually, I let him win. I didnt want to see his whole head explode because of a stupid arm-wrestling match. He jumped up and pumped his fists, cheering for himself. Hey— he cried out as the trailer swayed hard, and he went crashing into the wall. The trailer lurched again. I grabbed the table'

const u = 'to keep from falling off my seat. Whats going on? We changed direction. Were heading down now, Elliot replied. He edged his way back toward the table. But we bumped hard, and he toppled to the floor. Hey—were going backwards  Ill bet Moms driving, I said, holding on to the table edge with both hands. Mom always drives like a crazy person. When you warn her that shes going eighty, she always says, That cant be right. It feels as if Im going thirty-five The trailer was bouncing and bumping, rolling downhill. Elliot and I were bouncing and bumping with the trailer. What is their problem? Elliot cried, grabbing on to one of the beds, struggling to keep his balance. Are they backing up? Why are we going backwards? The trailer roared downhill. I pushed myself up from the table and stumbled to the front to see the car. Shoving aside the red plaid curtain, I peered out through the small window. Uh  Elliot  I choked out. Weve got a problem. Huh? A problem? he replied, bouncing harder as the trailer picked up speed. Mom and Dad arent pulling us anymore, I told him. The car is gone. Elliots face filled with confusion. He didnt understand me. Or maybe he didnt believe me The trailer has come loose I screamed, staring out the bouncing window. Were rolling downhill—on our own N-n-n-no Elliot chattered. He wasnt stuttering. He was bouncing so hard, he could barely speak. His sneakers hopped so hard on the trailer floor, he seemed to be tap dancing. OW I let out a pained shriek as my head bounced against the ceiling. Elliot and I stumbled to the back. Gripping the windowsill tightly, I struggled to see where we were heading. The road curved steeply downhill, through thick pine woods on both sides. The trees were a bouncing blur of greens and browns as we hurtled past. Picking up speed. Bouncing and tumbling. Faster. Faster. The tires roared beneath us. The trailer tilted and dipped. I fell to the floor. Landed hard on my knees. Reached to pull myself up. But the trailer swayed, and I went sprawling on my back. Pulling myself to my knees, I saw Elliot bouncing around on the floor like a soccer ball. I threw myself at the back of the trailer and peered out the window. The trailer bumped hard. The road curved sharply—but we didnt curve with it We shot off the side of the road. Swerved into the trees. Elliot I shrieked. Were going to crash The trailer jolted hard. I heard a cracking sound. Its going to break in half I thought. I pressed both hands against the front and stared out the window. Dark trees flew past. A hard bump sent me sprawling to the floor. I heard Elliot calling my name. Wendy Wendy Wendy I shut my eyes and tensed every muscle. And waited for the crash. Waited  Waited  Silence. I opened my eyes. It took me a few seconds to realize that we were no longer moving. I took a deep breath and climbed to my feet. Wendy? I heard Elliots weak cry from the back of the trailer. My legs were trembling as I turned around. My whole body felt weird. As if we were still bouncing. Elliot—are you okay? He had been thrown into one of the bottom bunks. Yeah. I guess, he replied. He lowered his feet to the floor and shook his head. Im kind of dizzy. Me, too, I confessed. What a ride Better than Space Mountain Elliot exclaimed. He climbed to his feet. Lets get out of this thing We both started to the door at the front. It was an uphill climb. The trailer tilted up. I reached the door first. I grabbed the handle. A loud knock on the door made me jump back. Hey I cried. Three more knocks. Its Mom and Dad Elliot cried. They found us Open it up Hurry He didnt have to tell me to hurry. My heart skipped. I was so glad to see them I turned the handle, pushed open the trailer door— —and gasped. I stared into the face of a blond-haired man. His blue eyes sparkled in the bright sunlight. He was dressed all in white. He wore a crisp white T-shirt tucked into baggy white shorts. A small round button pinned to his T-shirt read ONLY THE BEST in bold black letters. Uh  hi, I finally managed to choke out. He flashed me a gleaming smile. He seemed to have about two thousand teeth. Hey, guys—everyone okay in there? he asked. His blue eyes sparkled even brighter. Yeah. Were okay, I told him. A little shaken up, but— Who are you? Elliot cried, poking his head out the door. The guys smile didnt fade. My name is Buddy. Im Wendy. Hes Elliot. We thought you were our parents, I explained. I hopped down to the ground. Elliot followed me. Where are Mom and Dad? he asked, frowning. I havent seen anyone, guy, Buddy told him. He studied the trailer. What happened here? You came unhitched? I nodded, brushing my dark hair off my face. Yeah. On the steep hills, I guess. Dangerous, Buddy muttered. You must have been really scared. Not me Elliot declared. What a kid. First, hes shaking in terror and calling out my name over and over. Now hes Mister Macho. Ive never been so scared in all my life I admitted. I took a few steps away from the trailer and searched the woods. The trees creaked and swayed in a light breeze. The sun beamed down brightly. I shielded my eyes with one hand as I peered around. No sign of Mom and Dad. I couldnt see the highway through the thick trees. I could see the tire tracks our trailer had made through the soft dirt. Somehow we had shot through a clear path between the trees. The trailer had come to rest at the foot of a sharp, sloping hill. Wow. We were lucky, I muttered. Youre very lucky, Buddy declared cheerfully. He stepped up beside me, placed his hands on my shoulders, and turned me around. Check it out. Look where you guys landed Gazing up the hill, I saw a wide clearing between the trees. And then I saw a huge, red-and-white banner, stretched high on two poles. I had to squint to read the words on the banner.  Elliot read them aloud: King Jellyjams Sports Camp. The, camp is on the other side of the hill, Buddy told us, flashing us both a friendly smile. Come on Follow me But—but— my brother sputtered. We have to find our parents Hey—no problem, guy. You can wait for them at the camp, Buddy assured him. But how will they know where to find us? I protested. Should we leave a note? Buddy flashed me another dazzling smile. No. Ill take care of it, he told me. No problem. He stepped past the trailer and started up the hill. His white T-shirt and white shorts gleamed in the sunlight. I saw that his socks and high-tops were sparkling white, too. Thats his uniform. He must work at the camp, I decided. Buddy turned back. You guys coming? He motioned with both hands. Come on. Youre going to like it Elliot and I hurried to catch up to him. My legs trembled as I ran. I could still feel the trailer floor bouncing and jolting beneath me. I wondered if I would ever feel normal again. As we made our way up the grassy hill, the red-and-white banner came into clearer view. King Jellyjams Sports Camp, I read the words aloud. A funny, purple cartoon character had been drawn beside the words on the banner. He looked like a blob of grape bubble gum. He had a big smile on his face.'

const v = 'He wore a gold crown on his head. Whos that? I asked Buddy. Buddy glanced up at the banner. Thats King Jellyjam, he replied. Hes our little mascot. Weird-looking mascot for a sports camp, I declared, staring up at the purple, blobby king. Buddy didnt reply. Do you work at the camp? Elliot asked. Buddy nodded. Its a great place to work. Im the head counselor, guys. So— welcome But we cant go to your camp, I protested. We have to find our parents. We have to  Buddy put a hand on my shoulder and a hand on Elliots shoulder. He guided us up the hill. You guys have had a close call. You might as well stay and have some fun. Enjoy the camp. Until I can hook up with your parents. As we neared the top of the hill, I heard voices. Kids voices. Shouting and laughing. The clearing narrowed. Tall pine trees, birch trees, and maples clustered over the hill. What kind of sports camp is it? Elliot asked Buddy.  We play all kinds of sports, Buddy replied. From Ping-Pong to football. From croquet to soccer. We have swimming. We have tennis. We have archery. We even have a marbles tournament Sounds like a cool place my brother declared, grinning at me. Only the best Buddy said, slapping Elliot on the shoulder. I reached the top of the hill first and peered down through the trees to the camp. It seemed to stretch for miles I could see two long, white, two-story buildings on either side. Between them, I saw several playing fields, a baseball diamond, a long row of tennis courts, and two enormous swimming pools. Those long, white buildings are the dorms, Buddy explained, pointing. Thats the girls dorm, and thats the boys. You guys can stay in them while youre here. Wow It looks awesome Elliot exclaimed. Two swimming pools Olympic size, Buddy told him. We have diving competitions, too. Are you into diving? Only inside the trailer I joked. Wendy is into swimming, Elliot told Buddy. I think theres a four-lap swim race this afternoon, Buddy told me. Ill check the schedule for you. The sun beamed on us as we followed the path down the hill. The back of my neck started to prickle. A cool swim sounded pretty good to me. Can anyone sign up for baseball? Elliot asked Buddy. I mean, do you have to be on a team or something? You can play any sport you want, Buddy told him. The only rule at King Jellyjams Sports Camp is to try hard. Buddy tapped the button on his T-shirt. Only The Best, he said. The breeze blew my hair back over my face. I knew I should have had it cut before vacation I decided Id have to find something to tie it back with as soon as I got into the dorm. A soccer match was under way on the nearest field. Whistles blew. Kids shouted. I saw a long row of archery targets at the far end of the soccer field. Buddy started jogging toward the field. Elliot stepped up beside me. Hey—we wanted to go to camp, right? he said, grinning. Well? We made it Before I could reply, he trotted after Buddy. I brushed back my hair one more time, then followed. But I stopped when I saw a little girl poke her head out from behind a wide tree trunk. She appeared to be about six or seven. She had bright red hair and a face full of freckles. She wore a pale blue T-shirt pulled down over black tights. Hey— she called in a loud whisper. Hey— I turned toward her, startled. Dont come in she called. Run away Dont come in Buddy turned back quickly. Whats the problem, Wendy?  he called. When I returned my eyes to the tree, the red-haired girl had vanished. I blinked a couple of times. No trace of her. What was that girl doing out here? I wondered. Did she hide behind that tree just to scare people? Uh  no problem,  I called to Buddy. I followed Elliot and the counselor into the camp. I quickly forgot all about the girl as we made our way around the soccer field and past a long row of fenced-in tennis courts. The thwack of tennis balls followed us as we turned on to the main path that led through the camp. So many sports So much activity We pushed our way through kids of all ages, eagerly hurrying to the swimming pools, to the baseball diamond, to the bowling lanes Awesome  Elliot kept repeating. Totally awesome  And for once, he was right. We passed several other camp counselors. They were all young men and women, dressed completely in white, all of them good-looking and smiling cheerfully. And we passed dozens of little triangular signs showing the purple, blobby face of King Jellyjam, smiling out from under his shiny gold crown. Under each face was the camp slogan: Only The Best. Hes kind of cute, I decided. I realized I was starting to like everything about this amazing sports camp. And I have to confess I found myself secretly hoping that Mom and Dad wouldnt be able to find Elliot and me for at least a day or two. Isnt that terrible? I felt really guilty about it. But I couldnt help thinking it. This camp was just too exciting. Especially after days of riding in the backseat of the car, staring out at cows We dropped my brother off at the boys dorm first. Another counselor, a tall, dark-haired guy named Scooter, greeted Elliot and took my brother off to find a dorm room. Then Buddy led me to the girls dorm on the other side of the camp. We passed a gymnastics competition being held in an outdoor arena. Beyond that, one of the swimming pools was jammed with kids watching a diving contest off the high board. Buddy and I chatted as we walked. I told him about my school and about how my favorite sports are swimming and biking.  We stopped at the white double-door entrance to the dorm. Where are you from?  I asked him. Buddy stared back at me. He had such a confused expression on his face. For a moment, I thought he didnt understand the'

const w = 'question. Do you come from around here?  I asked. He swallowed hard. He squinted his blue eyes. Weird he muttered finally. Whats weird?  I demanded. I  I dont remember,  he stammered. I dont remember where Im from. Is that weird or what?  He raised his right hand to his mouth and nibbled his pointer finger. Hey, I forget stuff all the time,  I told him, seeing how upset he was. I didnt get a chance to say anything else. A young woman counselor with very short, straight black hair and bright purple-lipsticked lips came trotting up to us. Hello. Im Holly. Are you ready for some sports?  I guess,  I replied uncertainly. This is Wendy,  Buddy told her, his expression still troubled. She needs a room.  No problem  Holly declared cheerfully. Only The Best  Only The Best,  Buddy repeated quietly. He flashed me a smile. But I could see he was still struggling to remember where his home was. Weird, huh? Holly led the way into the dorm. I followed her down a long, white-tiled hall. Several girls came running past, on their way to different sports. They were all shouting and laughing excitedly. I peeked into some of the open rooms as we passed by them. Wow I thought. This place is so modern and luxurious Its not exactly your basic, rustic summer camp. We dont stay in the rooms much at all,  Holly told me. Everyone is always outdoors, competing.  She pushed open a white door and motioned for me to step in. Bright sunlight flooded the room from a wide window on the opposite wall. I saw two bright blue bunk beds against each wall. A sleek white dresser between them. Two white leather armchairs. The walls were white. They were bare except for a small, framed drawing of King Jellyjam above the dresser. Nice room  I exclaimed, squinting against the bright sunlight. Holly smiled. Her bright purple lips made the rest of her features seem to disappear. Glad you like it, Wendy. You can take that bottom bunk over there.  She pointed. She had purple fingernails that matched her lipstick. Do I have roommates?  I asked. Holly nodded. Youll meet them soon. Theyll get you started with some activities. I think theyre playing soccer on the lower field. Im not sure.  She started out of the room, but turned at the doorway. Youll like Dierdre. I think shes about your age.  Thanks,  I said, gazing around the room. Catch you later,  Holly replied. She vanished into the hall.  I stood in the center of the sunlit room, thinking hard. What am I supposed to do for clothes? I wondered. What about swimsuits? Sweats? All I had were the denim short-shorts and pink-and-blue-striped T-shirt I was wearing. And why didnt Holly tell me where to go next? I asked myself. Why did she just leave me by myself in this empty room? I didnt have long to ask myself questions. I started to cross to the window when I heard voices. Whispered voices outside the door. I turned to the door. Were my roommates returning? I listened to the excited buzz of whispers. Then I heard a girl loudly instruct the others. Come on. Weve got her trapped in there. Lets get her  I gasped and searched frantically for a place to hide. No time. Three girls burst into the room, their eyes narrowed, their mouths twisted into menacing sneers. They formed a line and moved toward me quickly. Whoa Wait  I cried. I raised both hands as if to shield myself from their attack. The tall girl with streaky blond hair was the first to laugh. Then the other two joined in. Gotcha,  the blond girl declared, tossing back her long hair triumphantly. I glared back at her, my mouth hanging open. Did you really think we were going to attack?  one of the others asked. She was thin and wiry, with very short black hair cut into bangs. She wore gray sweats and a torn gray T-shirt. Well I started. I could feel my face growing hot. Their little joke had really fooled me. I felt like a total jerk. Dont look at me,  the third girl said, shaking her head. She had frizzy blond hair tumbling out from beneath a blue and red Chicago Cubs cap. It was all Dierdres idea.  She pointed to the girl with streaky blond hair. Dont feel bad,  Dierdre told me, grinning. Her green eyes flashed. Youre the third girl this week.  The other two snickered. And did the others think you were attacking?  I asked. Dierdre nodded, very pleased with herself. Its kind of a mean joke,  she admitted. But its funny.  This time I joined in the laughter. I have a younger brother. Im used to dumb jokes,  I told Dierdre. She swept back her hair again. Rummaged around on the dresser top. Found a hair scrunchy to hold it back. This is Jan and this is Ivy,  she said, motioning to the other girls. Jan was the one with the short black bangs. She slumped on to a lower bunk. Im whipped,  she sighed. What a workout. Look at me. Im sweating like a pig.  Ever hear of deodorant?  Ivy cracked. Jan stuck out her tongue at Ivy in reply. Get changed,  Dierdre instructed them both. Weve only got ten minutes.  Ten minutes till what?  Jan demanded, bending down and rubbing her calf muscles. Did you forget the four-lap race?  Dierdre replied.  Oh, wow  Jan cried, jumping up. I did forget.  She hurried to the dresser. Wheres my swimsuit?  Ivy followed her. They began frantically sifting through the drawers. Dierdre turned to me. Do you want to enter the race?  she asked. I—I dont have a swimsuit,  I replied. She shrugged. No problem. I have about a dozen.  She studied me. Were about the same size. Im just a little taller.  Well, Id love a swim,  I told her. Maybe Ill just go to the pool and splash around for a while.  Huh? Not compete?  Dierdre cried. All three girls turned to me, stunned expressions on their faces. Ill do some sports later,  I said. Right now, I just want to dive in and swim a little. You know. Cool off.  But—you cant  Jan cried. She gaped at me as if I had suddenly grown a second head. No way,  Ivy said, shaking her head. You have to compete,  Dierdre added. You cant just swim.  Only The Best,  Ivy recited. Right. Only The Best,  Jan agreed. I felt totally confused. What do you mean?  I demanded. Why do you keep saying that?  Dierdre tossed me a blue swimsuit. Put it on. Were going to be late.  But  but—  I sputtered. The three girls hurried to get into their swimsuits. I saw that I had no choice. I went into the bathroom and started to change. But my questions repeated in my mind. I really wanted them answered. Why did I have to compete in the race? Why couldnt I just have a swim? And why did everyone keep repeating Only The Best ? What did they mean? The enormous blue pool sparkled under the bright sunlight. The sun hovered high overhead. The concrete burned the soles of my bare feet. I couldnt wait to get into the water. Shielding my eyes with one hand, I searched for Elliot. But I couldnt find him in the crowd of kids who were waiting to watch the race. Elliot has probably already played three sports, I told myself. This had to be the perfect camp for my brother I gazed down the line of girls waiting to compete in the four-lap race. We all stood on the edge of the deep end of the pool, waiting to jump in. I silently counted. There were at least two dozen girls in this race. And the pool was wide enough for all of us to have a lane to swim in. Hey, you look terrific in my suit,  Dierdre said. Her green eyes studied me. You should have tied your hair back, Wendy. Its going to slow you down.  Wow, I thought. Dierdre really cares about winning. Are you a good swimmer?  I asked her. She swatted a fly on the back of her calf. The best,  she replied, grinning. How about you?  Ive never really raced,  I told her. The pool counselors were all young women. They wore white two-piece swimsuits. Across the pool, I saw Holly sitting on the edge of the diving board, talking to another counselor. A tall, red-haired counselor moved to the edge of the pool and blew her whistle. Everyone ready?  she called. We all shouted back that we were ready. Then the long line of girls grew silent. We turned to the pool, leaned forward, and prepared to dive in. The water shimmered beneath me. The sun burned down on my back and shoulders. I felt about to melt. I couldnt wait to jump in. The whistle blew. I sprang forward and hit the water hard. I gasped from the shock of the cold against my hot skin. My arms churned hard as I pulled myself forward. The splash of thrashing arms and kicking feet sounded like the roar of a waterfall. I dipped my face into the water, feeling the refreshing coldness. Turning my head, I glimpsed Dierdre a few lengths behind me. She swam in a steady rhythm, her arms and legs moving smoothly, gracefully. Im ahead of everyone, I realized, glancing across the pool. Im winning the race  With a hard kick, I reached the other end of the pool. I made a sharp turn and pushed off. As I started back to the deep end, the other girls were still approaching the shallow end wall. I pulled myself harder. My heart started to pound. I knew Id win the first lap easily. Then there were three laps to go. Three laps  I suddenly realized how dumb I was. The other girls were pacing themselves. They werent swimming full speed because they knew it was a four-lap race. If I kept swimming this hard, I wouldnt survive two laps I sucked in a deep breath, then let it out slowly. Slowly  slowly  That was the word of the day. I slowed my kicking. Shot my arms out and pulled them back slowly. Took long breaths. Long, slow breaths. As I made my turn and started the second lap, several other swimmers had moved beside me. I caught Dierdres eye as she swam past. She never broke her steady rhythm. Stroke. Stroke. Breath. Stroke. On the other side of Dierdre, I saw Jan swimming comfortably, easily. Jan was so small and light. She seemed to float over the water. Into the third lap. I kept a few lengths behind Dierdre. I had to concentrate on keeping a slow, even pace. I pretended I was a robot, programmed to swim slowly. Dierdre turned into the fourth lap a few seconds ahead of me. I saw her expression change as she made her turn. She narrowed her eyes. Her entire face grew tight and tense. Dierdre really wants to win, I saw. I wondered if I could catch her. I wondered if I could beat her. I made my turn and put on the speed. I ignored the aching in my arms. I ignored the cramp in my left foot. I thrust myself forward, kicking hard from the waist. My hands cut through the water. Faster. I glimpsed Jan fall behind. I saw the disappointment on her face as I passed by. Pounding, thrusting arms and legs churned the water to froth. The splashing became a roar. The roar nearly drowned out the cheers of the kids watching from around the pool. My heart thudded so hard, I thought my chest might explode. My arms ached. They felt as if they each weighed a thousand pounds. Faster  I pulled up beside Dierdre. Close. So close, I could hear her gasping breaths. I glimpsed her face, tight with concentration. Shes just like Elliot, I decided. She wants to win so badly.'

const x = 'Lots of times I let Elliot win a game. Because he cared about it so much more than I did. And so did Dierdre.  As we neared the wall at the deep end, I let Dierdre pull ahead. I saw how much it meant to her. I saw how desperate she was to finish first. What the heck, I thought. Theres nothing wrong with coming in second. I heard the cheers ring out as Dierdre won the race. I touched the wall, then dipped below the surface. I pulled myself up and grabbed the wall. My entire body ached and throbbed. I gasped in breath after breath. I shut my eyes and pulled my hair back with both hands, squeezing the water out of it. My arms were so tired, I could barely pull myself out of the pool. I was one of the last swimmers out. The others had all formed a circle around Dierdre. I pushed my way into the crowd of girls to see what was happening. My eyes burned. I brushed water out of them. I saw the red-haired counselor hand something to Dierdre. Something gold and shiny. Everyone cheered. Then the circle broke, and the girls all headed in different directions. I made my way up to Dierdre. Way to go  I exclaimed. I came close. But youre really fast.  Im on the swim team at school,  she replied. She held up the gold object the counselor had given her. I could see it clearly now. A shiny gold coin. It had a smiling King Jellyjam engraved on it. I couldnt read the words around the edge of the coin. But I could guess what they were. Its my fifth King Coin  Dierdre declared proudly. Why is she so excited about it? I wondered. It wasnt a real coin. It probably wasnt even real gold Whats a King Coin?  I asked. The coin gleamed in the sunlight. If I win one more King Coin, I can walk in the Winners Walk,  Dierdre explained. I started to ask what the Winners Walk was. But Jan and Ivy came running up to congratulate Dierdre. And the three of them all started talking at once. I suddenly remembered my brother. Where is Elliot? I wondered. What has he been doing? I turned away from Dierdre and the other girls and started toward the pool exit. But I had only taken a few steps when I heard someone calling my name. I spun around to see Holly jogging toward me. Her purple-lipsticked lips were knotted in a fretful expression. Wendy, youd better come with me,  the counselor told me. My heart skipped. Huh? Whats wrong?  I asked. Im afraid theres a problem,  Holly said softly. Something happened to Mom and Dad Thats the first thought that burst into my head. Whats wrong?  I cried. My parents Are they okay? Are they—  We havent found your parents yet,  Holly said. She wrapped a towel around my trembling shoulders. Then she led me to a bench at the side of the pool. Is it Elliot?  I cried, dropping down beside her. What is wrong?  Holly kept one arm around my shoulders. She leaned close. Her brown eyes stared into mine. Wendy, the problem is that you didnt really try very hard to win the race,  she said. I swallowed hard. Excuse me?  I watched you,  Holly continued. I saw you slow your strokes in the last lap. I dont think you tried your best to win.  But—but—I—  I sputtered. Holly continued to stare at me without blinking. Am I right?  she demanded softly. I—Im not used to swimming that far,  I stammered. It was my first race. I didnt think—  I know youre new at camp,  Holly said, brushing a fly off my leg. But you know the camp slogan, right?  For sure,  I replied. Its everywhere I look But what does it mean? Only The Best  I guess its kind of a warning,  Holly replied thoughtfully. Thats why I decided to talk to you now, Wendy.  A warning?  I cried. I felt more confused than ever. A warning about what?  Holly didnt reply. She forced a smile to her face and stood up. Catch you later, okay?  She turned and hurried away. I wrapped the towel tighter around my shoulders and started back to the dorm to change. As I walked past the tennis courts, I thought hard about Hollys warning. Why was it so important for me to win the race? So that I could be awarded, one of those gold coins with the blobby purple king on it? Why should I care about winning coins? Why couldnt I just play some games, make new friends, and have fun? Why did Holly say she was giving me a warning? A warning about what?  I shook my head, trying to shake away all these puzzling questions. Id heard about sports camps from some of my friends back home. Some camps, they said, were really tough. The kids were all serious jock types who wanted to win, win, win. I guessed this was one of those camps. Oh, well, I thought, sighing. I dont have to love this camp. Mom and Dad will be here soon to take Elliot and me away. I glanced up—and saw Elliot. Sprawled face down on the ground. His arms and legs spread out awkwardly. His eyes closed. Unconscious. Ooooh  I let out a frightened wail. Elliot Elliot  I dropped down beside him. He sat up and grinned at me. How many times are you going to fall for that?  he asked. He started to laugh. I slugged him in the shoulder as hard as I could. You creep  That made him laugh even harder. It really cracks him up when he makes me look like a jerk. Why do I always fall for the stupid joke? Elliot pulls it on me all the time. And I always believe hes been knocked out cold. Im never falling for that again. Never  I cried. Elliot pulled himself to his feet. Come watch me play Ping-Pong,  he said, tugging my hand. Im in the tournament. Im beating this kid Jeff. He thinks hes good because he puts a spin on his serve. But hes pitiful.  I cant,  I replied. I pulled out of his grasp. Im dripping wet. I have to change.  Come watch,  he insisted. It wont take long. Ill beat him really fast, okay?  Elliot—  He certainly was excited. If I beat Jeff, I win a King Coin,  he announced. Then Im going to win five more. I want to win six so I can walk in the Winners Walk before Mom and Dad come for us.  Good luck,  I mumbled, rubbing my wet hair with the towel. Were you in a swim race? Did you win?  Elliot asked, tugging my hand again. No. I came in second,  I told him. He snickered. Youre a loser. Come watch me beat this kid.  I rolled my eyes. Okay, okay.  Elliot pulled me to a row of outdoor Ping-Pong tables. They were shielded from the sun by a broad, white canvas awning. He hurried up to the table on the end. Jeff was waiting for him there, softly bouncing a Ping-Pong ball in the air with his paddle. I had pictured a little shrimpy guy that Elliot could beat easily.'

const y = 'But Jeff was a big, red-faced, blond kid with bulging muscles. He had to be twice the size of my brother I took a seat on a white wooden bench across from the tables. Elliot cant beat this big guy, I thought. My poor brother is in for a major defeat. As they started to play, Buddy came walking over and sat down beside me. He flashed me a smile. No word from your parents yet,  he said. But well find them.  We watched the Ping-Pong match. Jeff did his serve with the special spin. Elliot slammed it back at him.  To my surprise, the match was really even. I think Jeff was surprised, too. His returns became more and more wild. And a lot of his special serves missed the table entirely They had already played two games, Buddy told me. Jeff had won the first, Elliot the second. This was the third and deciding match. The game was a tie at sixteen, then a tie at seventeen and eighteen. I watched Elliot become more and more intense. He wanted desperately to win. He leaned stiffly over the table, gripping the paddle so tightly, his hand was white. Sweat poured off his forehead. He began ducking and dodging, groaning with each hit, trying to slam every ball. The more frantic and wild Elliot became, the calmer Jeff appeared. The game was a tie at nineteen. Elliot missed a shot and angrily slammed his paddle against the table. I could see that he was losing it. Id seen this happen to my brother many times before. He could never win if he stayed this intense. As he held the ball and prepared to serve, I raised two fingers to the sides of my mouth and blew hard. He lowered the paddle when he heard my loud whistle. That was my signal. Id used it many times before. It meant, Cool it, Elliot. Calm down.  Elliot turned and gave me a quick thumbs-up. I saw him take a deep breath. Then another. My whistle signal always helped him. He raised the ball and served it to Jeff. Jeff sent back a weak return. Elliot smacked it back into the right corner. Jeff swung off balance and missed. Jeff served the next one. Elliot backhanded it. Very soft. The ball tipped over the net and dribbled several times on Jeffs side. Elliot had won He let out a gleeful cheer and raised his fists in victory. Jeff angrily heaved his paddle to the ground and stomped away. Your brother is good,  Buddy said, climbing to his feet. I like his style. Hes intense.  For sure,  I muttered. Buddy hurried over to award Elliot his King Coin. Hey, guy—you only need five more,  Buddy said, slapping Elliot a high five, then a low five. No problem,  Elliot bragged. He held the coin up so I could see it. King Jellyjam smiled out at me, engraved on the coin. Why did the camp pick this silly little blob for a mascot? I wondered again. He looked like a fat hunk of pudding wearing a crown. Ive got to get changed,  I told Elliot. He slid the gold coin into the pocket of his shorts. Im going to find another sport  he declared. I want to win another King Coin before tonight  I waved good-bye, then started toward the dorm. I had walked only a few steps when I heard a low rumbling. Then the ground started to shake.  I froze. Every muscle in my body locked as the rumbling grew louder. Earthquake  I cried. The ground shook hard. The awning over the Ping-Pong tables shook. The tables bounced on the ground. My knees buckled. I struggled to stay on my feet. Earthquake  I choked out again. Its okay  Buddy called, running toward me. He was right. The rumbling sound faded quickly. The ground stopped shaking. That happens sometimes,  Buddy explained. Its no problem.  My heart still thudded in my chest. My legs wobbled as if they were rubber bands. No problem?  See?  Buddy motioned around the crowded camp. No one pays any attention. It lasts only a few seconds.  I gazed around quickly. Buddy was right again. The kids in the chess tournament in front of the lodge didnt glance up from their chessboards. The kickball game on the field across from the pool continued without a pause. It usually happens once or twice a day,  Buddy told me. But what causes it?  I demanded. He shrugged. Beats me.  But—everything shook so hard Isnt it dangerous?  I asked. Buddy didnt hear me. He was already jogging over to watch the kickball game. I turned and started walking to the dorm. I felt kind of shaky. I could still hear that strange rumbling sound in my ears. As I pulled open the door to the dorm, I bumped into Jan and Ivy. They both had changed into white tennis outfits, and they both carried tennis rackets over their shoulders. What sports have you been playing?  Did you win a King Coin?  Wasnt that a great swim race?  Are you having fun, Wendy?  Do you play tennis?  They both talked at once and shot out half a dozen questions. They seemed really excited. They didnt give me a chance to answer. We need more girls for the tennis tournament,  Ivy said. Were having a twoday tournament. Come to the courts after lunch, okay?  Okay,  I agreed. Im not that good, but—  See you later  Jan cried. They both hurried away. Actually, I am a pretty good tennis player. I have a decent serve. And I do all right with my two-handed backhand.  But Im not great. Back home, my friend Allison and I always play for fun. We dont try to kill each other. Sometimes we just keep volleying back and forth. We dont even keep score. Ill enter the tennis tournament, I decided. And if I lose in the first round, its no big deal. Besides, I told myself, Mom and Dad will be here any minute. And Elliot and I will have to leave. Mom and Dad  their faces flashed into my mind. They must be frantic, I realized. They must be worried sick. I hoped they were okay. I suddenly had an idea. Ill call home, I decided. I should have thought of this before. Ill call home and leave a message on our answering machine. Ill tell Mom and Dad on the machine where Elliot and I are. No matter where he goes, Dad checks for phone messages every hour. Mom always makes fun of him for being so nervous about missing a call. But theyll both be glad to get this message I told myself. What a good idea I congratulated myself. Now all I needed was a phone. There have to be phones in the dorm, I decided. I searched the small front lobby. But I didnt see any pay phones. No one at the front desk. No one I could ask. I peered down a long hallway. Rooms on both sides. No phones. I tried the other hallway. No pay phones there, either. Eager to make my call, I turned and hurried back outside. I let out a long sigh of relief when I spotted two pay phones beside the long white dorm building. My heart pounding, I jogged over to them. I picked up the phone closest to me. And I started to raise the receiver to my ear— —when two strong hands grabbed me from behind. Get off the phone  a voice demanded. Huh?  I shrieked in surprise and dropped the phone. It spun crazily on its cord. I turned around. Dierdre You scared me to death  I cried. Her green eyes flashed excitedly. Sorry, Wendy. I just had to tell you my news Look  She held out her hand. I saw a stack of gold King Coins. I just won my sixth coin  Dierdre declared breathlessly. Isnt that awesome?  I—I guess,  I replied uncertainly. I still couldnt figure out why it was such a big deal. Ill be in the Winners Walk tonight  Dierdre exclaimed. I cant believe I made it  Thats great,  I told her. Congratulations.  Have you won any King Coins yet?  Dierdre asked, still holding out her hand. Uh  not yet,  I replied. Well, get going  Dierdre urged. Show them what youve got, Wendy. Only The Best  She flashed me a thumbs-up with her free hand. Right. Only The Best,  I repeated. Well have a party,  Dierdre continued. In our room. Right after the Winners Walk. Okay? Well celebrate.  Great  I replied. Maybe we can get a pizza from the'

const z = 'mess hall or something.  Tell Jan and Ivy,  Dierdre instructed. Or Ill tell them. Whoever sees them first See you later  She ran off, holding the six gold coins tightly in her fist. I realized I was smiling. Dierdre had been so excited, shed gotten me excited. So excited, I forgot about my phone call. I have to give this camp a chance, I decided. I have to get into the spirit of things and start having some fun. Only The Best Im going to win that tennis tournament We all ate dinner at long wooden tables in the huge mess hall inside the main camp lodge. The long, high-ceilinged room seemed to stretch on forever. Loud voices and laughter echoed off the walls over the clatter of plates and silverware. Everyone had a story to tell. Everyone wanted to talk about the games of the day. After dinner, the counselors led us all to the running track. I searched for Elliot. But I couldnt find him in the crowd. It was a warm, clear night. A pale sliver of a moon floated low over the darkening trees. As the sun set, the sky faded from pink to purple to gray.  When darkness fell, I saw two flickering yellow lights at the far end of the track, moving toward me. As they came near, I could see that they were torches, carried by two counselors. A blaring trumpet fanfare made us all grow quiet. I stepped closer to Jan, who stood at my side. They sure make a big deal of this,  I whispered. It is a big deal,  Jan replied, her eyes straight ahead as the torches approached. Do we have any food for the party later?  I whispered. Jan raised a finger to her lips. Ssshhhh.  Several more torches had been lit. The yellow balls of light glowed like tiny suns. I heard a drumroll. Then a loud march blared from the loudspeaker, all trumpets and pounding drums. We stood in silence as the parade of torches passed by. And, then, in the flickering yellow light, I saw faces. The smiling faces of the kids who had won their sixth King Coin that day. I counted eight kids. Five boys and three girls. Their gold coins had been strung as necklaces around their necks. The coins caught the light of the torches and made the faces of the winners appear to glow as they marched by. Dierdre marched second in line. She seemed so happy and excited Her coins jangled at her throat. Her smile never faded. Jan and I waved and called to her, but she marched right past. A counselors voice suddenly boomed over the loudspeaker: Lets hear it for our winners who are taking the Winners Walk tonight  A deafening cheer rose up from the kids watching the parade. We all clapped and shouted and whistled until the winners had marched past and the final torches had floated out of sight. Only The Best  the voice shouted over the loudspeaker. Only The Best  we all chanted back. Only The Best  That ended the Winners Walk parade. The lights came on. We all scrambled toward the dorms. The boys ran in one direction, the girls in the other. The torches were really cool,  I said to Jan as we followed the crowd of girls down the path to the dorm. I only need two more King Coins,  Jan replied. Maybe I can win them tomorrow. Are you playing in the softball tournament?  No. Tennis,  I told her. There are too many good tennis players,  Jan replied. Itll be too hard to win a coin. You should play softball, too. Well  maybe, I replied. Ivy was already waiting for us in the room. Wheres Dierdre? she demanded as Jan and I entered. We didnt see her, Jan replied. Probably hanging out with the other winners, I added. I found two bags of tortilla chips, but I couldnt find any salsa, Ivy reported, holding up the bags.  Do we have anything to drink? I asked. Ivy held up two cans of diet Coke. Wow Great party Jan exclaimed, laughing. Maybe we should invite some girls in from other rooms, I suggested. No way Then wed have to share the Cokes Jan protested. We all laughed. The three of us joked and kidded around for about half an hour, waiting for Dierdre. We sat down on the floor and opened one of the bags of tortilla chips. Without realizing it, we finished off the whole bag. Then we passed around one of the cans of soda. Where is she? Jan demanded, glancing at her watch. Its nearly time for lights-out, Ivy sighed. We wont have much time for a party. Maybe Dierdre forgot we were having a party, I suggested, crinkling up the tortilla chip bag and tossing it toward the trash basket. I missed. Basketball is definitely not my sport. But the party was her idea Ivy replied. She climbed to her feet and started pacing back and forth. Where can she be? Everyone is inside by now. Lets go find her, I said. The words just popped out of my mouth. That happens to me sometimes. I get a bright idea before I know what Im saying. Yes Lets go Ivy eagerly agreed. Whoa. Hold it, Jan said, stepping in front of us, blocking our way to the door. Were not allowed. You know the rules, Ivy. Were not allowed outside after ten. Well sneak out, find Dierdre, and sneak back in, Ivy replied. Come on, Jan. What could happen? Right. What could happen? I chimed in. Jan was outnumbered. Okay, okay. But I hope we dont get caught, she muttered. She followed Ivy and me to the door. What could happen? I asked myself, leading the way into the empty hall. What could happen? I repeated as we sneaked out the door, into the night. What could happen? I didnt know it. But the answer to the question was: A LOT The night had grown warmer. And steamier. As I crept out the door, I felt as if I were stepping into a hot shower. A mosquito buzzed around my head. I tried to clap it between my hands. Missed. Jan, Ivy, and I edged our way around the side of the building. My shoes slid on the dew-wet grass. Bright spotlights shone down from the trees, lighting the path. We crept in the shadows. Where should we look first? Ivy whispered. Lets start at the lodge, I suggested. Maybe all of tonights winners are partying there. I dont hear any partying, Jan whispered. Its so quiet out here She was right. The only sounds I could hear were the steady chirp of crickets and the whisper of the warm wind through the trees. Keeping in the shadows, we followed the path toward the lodge. We passed the swimming pool, empty and silent. The water shimmered like silver under the bright spotlights. It was such a hot, wet night, I imagined myself jumping into the pool with all of my clothes on. But we were on a mission: To find Dierdre. No time to think about late-night swims. Staying close together, we passed the row of Ping-Pong tables. They made me think of Elliot. I wondered what he was doing. Probably tucked into bed. Like any sensible person. We were approaching the first row of tennis courts when Ivy suddenly cried out, Whoa Get back She grabbed me and shoved me hard against the fence. I heard soft footsteps on the path. Someone humming. The three of us held our breath as a counselor walked past. He had curly black hair and wore dark blue sunglasses even though it was night. He wore the white Tshirt and white shorts that made up the counselors uniform. We pressed our backs against the tennis court fence. Thats Billy, Jan whispered. Hes kind of cute. Hes always so happy. He wont be too happy if he catches us, Ivy whispered. Well be in major trouble. Humming to himself, snapping his fingers, Billy walked past us. The path curved around the other side of the tennis courts. I watched him until he disappeared. I took a deep breath. I hadnt been breathing the whole time Wheres he going? Ivy wondered. Maybe hes going to the party at the lodge, I suggested.  Why dont we ask him? Jan joked. For sure, I muttered. We checked out the path in both directions. Then we started walking again. We made our way past the tennis courts. The spotlights in the trees cast long shadows across the path. The shadows shifted and moved as the tree limbs bobbed in the wind. They looked like dark creatures crawling and slithering over the ground. Despite the heat of the night, I shivered. It was kind of creepy walking over these moving shadows. I had the feeling one of them might reach up, grab me, and pull me down. Weird thought, huh? I turned back in time to see the lights in the dorm windows start to go out. Lightsout. I tapped Jan on the shoulder. She turned and watched the dorm, too. As the lights all went out, the building seemed to disappear in front of our eyes. It faded into the black of the night sky. M-maybe this wasnt such a good idea, I whispered. Ivy didnt reply. She bit her lower lip. Her eyes were darting around the darkness. Jan laughed. Dont wimp out now, she scolded. Were almost to the lodge. We cut through the soccer field. The main lodge stood on a low, sloping hill, hidden by wide, old maple and sassafras trees. We didnt have to climb very far up the hill to see that the lodge was as dark as the dorm. No party up there, I whispered. Ivy sighed, disappointed. Well, where could Dierdre be? We could try the boys dorm I joked. They both laughed. Our laughter was cut short by a loud fluttering sound, very close by. Whats that? Ivy cried. Ohhh I let out a low moan as I raised my eyes and saw them. The sky was thick with bats. Dozens of black bats. Fluttering over the spotlights in the old trees. And, then—swooping down to get us I couldnt help myself. I let out a scream. Then I shielded my face with both hands. I heard Jan and Ivy gasp. The fluttering grew louder. Closer. I could feel the bats hot breath on the back of my neck. Then I could feel them clawing at my hair, tearing at my face. Ive got a real good imagination when it comes to bats. Wendy, its okay, Jan whispered. She tugged my hands from my face. She pointed. Look. I followed her gaze up to the fluttering black wings. The bats were swooping low. But they werent swooping at us. They were swooping down and landing on the swimming pool at the bottom of the hill. In the bright spotlights, I could see them dart into the water—for less than a second. Then sweep back up to the sky. I—I dont like bats, I whispered. Neither do I, Ivy confessed. I know theyre supposed to be good. I know they eat insects and stuff. But I still think theyre creepy. Well, they wont bother us, Jan said. Theyre just taking a drink. She gave Ivy and me a push to get us started down the hill. We were lucky. Nobody had heard me scream. But we had walked only a few steps when we spotted another counselor coming down the path. I recognized her. She had straight white-blond hair that tumbled down to her waist from under a blue baseball cap. Without making a sound, all three of us dove behind a tall evergreen shrub and crouched down. Did she see us? I held my breath again. She kept walking. Where are these counselors going? Ivy whispered. Lets follow her, I suggested. Stay far back, Jan instructed. We slowly climbed back to our feet. And stepped out from behind the shrub. And stopped when we heard the low, rumbling sound. As the rumbling grew louder, the ground began to shake. I caught the frightened expressions on my two friends faces. Ivy and Jan were just as scared as I was.  The ground shook harder, so hard that we dropped to our knees. I leaned on all'

const aa = 'fours, holding on to the grass. The ground trembled and shook. The rumbling became a roar. I shut my eyes. The sound slowly faded. The ground gave a final tremble, then remained still. I opened my eyes and turned to Ivy and Jan. They started to stand. Slowly. I hate when that happens Jan muttered. What is it? I whispered. I stood up on shaky legs. Nobody knows, Jan replied, brushing grass stains off her knees. It just happens. A few times a day. I think we should give up on Dierdre, Ivy said quietly. I want to go back. To the dorm. Yeah. Im with you, I replied wearily. We can have our celebration with Dierdre tomorrow. She can tell us all about where she was tonight and what she did, Jan said. This was a crazy idea, I muttered. It was your idea Jan exclaimed. Most of my ideas are crazy I replied. Hiding in the shadows, we made our way down to the path. I gazed toward the pool. The bats had disappeared. Maybe the rumbling sound had scared them back into the woods. The crickets had stopped chirping. The air remained hot, but silent and still. The only sound was the scrape of our sneakers on the soft dirt path. And, then—before we could move or hide—we heard someone elses footsteps. Rapid footsteps. Running hard. Running toward us. I stopped short when I heard a girls desperate cry. Help me Please— somebody Help me A hot gust of wind shook the trees, making their eerie dark shadows dance. I leaped back, startled by the girls terrified cries. Help me Please— She came running around from the side of the tennis courts. She wore tight blue short-shorts and a magenta midriff top. Her arms were stretched out in front of her. Her long hair flew wildly behind her head. I recognized her as soon as she burst into view. The little red-haired girl with all the freckles. The one who had hidden in the woods and warned Elliot and me not to come into the camp. Help me She ran right into me, sobbing hard. I threw my arms around her tiny shoulders and held her. Youre okay, I whispered. Youre okay. No she shrieked. She tugged away from me. Whats wrong? Jan demanded. Why are you out here? Why arent you in bed? Ivy added, stepping up beside me. The little girl didnt answer. Her entire body trembled. She grabbed my hand and pulled me behind the bushes beside the path. Jan and Ivy followed. Im not okay, she started, wiping the tears off her freckled cheeks with both hands. Im not. I—I— Whats your name? Jan asked in a whisper. Why are you out here? Ivy repeated. I heard the flutter of bat wings again, low overhead. But I stared at the little girl and forced myself to ignore them. My name—its Alicia, the girl replied, sobbing. Weve got to go. Fast Huh? I cried. Take a deep breath, Alicia. Youre okay. Really. No she cried again, shaking her head. Youre safe now. Youre with us, I insisted. Were not safe, she cried. No one. No one here. I tried to warn people. I tried to tell you  Her words were cut off once again by her loud sobs. What is it? Ivy demanded. What did you try to warn us about? Jan asked, leaning down to the crying girl. I—I saw something terrible Alicia stammered. I— What did you see? I asked impatiently.  I followed them, Alicia replied. And I saw it. Something horrible. I—I cant talk about it. We just have to run. We have to tell the others. Everyone. We have to run. We have to get away from here She let out a long breath. Her entire body trembled again. But why do we have to run? I asked, placing my hands gently on her shoulders. I felt so bad. I wanted to calm her. I wanted to tell her that everything would be okay. But I didnt know how to convince her. What had she seen? What had frightened her so much? Had she had a bad dream? We have to go now she repeated shrilly. Her red hair was matted to her face by her tears. She grabbed my arm and pulled hard. Hurry Weve got to run I saw it Saw what? I cried. Alicia had no time to reply. A dark-haired counselor stepped up in front of the bushes. Caught you he cried. I froze. My entire body went cold. The counselors dark eyes flashed in the light of a spotlight. What are you doing out here? he demanded. I sucked in a deep breath and started to answer. But another voice replied before I could. Kind of nosy, arent you? It was another counselor. A woman with short, black hair. Breathing hard, trying not to make a sound, I ducked lower behind the bushes. My two friends dropped to their knees. You arent following me—are you? the first counselor teased. Why would I follow you? Maybe youre following me the woman teased back. They didnt see us, I realized happily. We were two feet away from them. But they didnt see us behind the bushes. A few seconds later, the two counselors strolled off together. My friends and I waited a long while, listening hard until we could no longer hear their voices. Then we climbed slowly to our feet. Alicia? I asked. Are you okay? Alicia? Ivy and Jan cried. The little girl had vanished. We sneaked back into the dorm through a side door. Luckily, there were no counselors patrolling the halls. No one in sight. Dierdre—are you back? Jan called as we stepped into our room. No reply. I clicked on the light. Dierdres bunk remained empty. Better turn off the light, Ivy warned. Its after lights-out. I clicked the light back off. Then I stumbled toward my bunk, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. Where is Dierdre? Ivy asked. Im a little worried about her. Maybe we should tell a counselor that shes missing. What counselor? Jan asked, slumping onto her bed. Theres no one around. The counselors are all out somewhere. Im sure shes partying somewhere and forgot all about us, I said, yawning. I bent to pull down the covers on my bed. What do you think that little girl saw? Ivy asked, peering out the window. Alicia? I think she had a bad dream, I replied.  But she was so frightened Jan said, shaking her head. And what was she doing outside? And why did she run away from us like that? Ivy added. Weird, I mumbled. Weird is right, Jan agreed. Weird is the word of the night. She made her way to the dresser. Im getting changed for bed. Big day tomorrow. Ive got to win two more King Coins. Me, too, Ivy said, yawning. Jan pulled out a dresser drawer. Oh, no she shrieked. No I dont believe it Jan—what is it? I cried. Ivy and I tore across the room to the dresser. Jan continued to stare down into the open drawer. Its so dark, she said. I opened Dierdres drawer by mistake. And—and—its empty Huh? Ivy and I both uttered our surprise. Squinting through the dim gray light, I studied the dresser drawer. Totally empty. Check the closet, I suggested. Ivy crossed the room in three or four quick strides. She pulled open the closet door. Dierdres stuff—its all gone Ivy declared. Weird, I muttered. It was still the word of the night. Why would she move out and not tell us? Jan demanded. Where did she go? Ivy added. Good question, I thought, staring at the empty closet. Where did Dierdre go? * * * Breakfast was the noisiest meal of the day. Spoons clattered against cereal bowls. Orange juice pitchers banged on the long wooden tables. Voices rang out as if someone had turned up the volume all the way. Everyone talked excitedly about the sports they planned to play today, the games they planned to win. I had taken the last shower. So Jan and Ivy were already eating breakfast when I made my way into the mess hall. As I pushed through the narrow aisle between the tables, I searched for Dierdre. No sign of her. I hadnt slept very well, even though I was really tired. I kept thinking about Dierdre—and about Alicia. And I kept wondering what was'

const ab = 'taking Mom and Dad so long to get in touch with us. I spotted Elliot at the end of a table filled with boys about his age. He had a stack of waffles in front of him, and he was pouring dark syrup over them. Elliot—whats up? I called, squeezing through the aisle to get over to him. My brother didnt bother saying good morning. Ive got a one-on-one tournament this morning, he reported excitedly. I could win my third King Coin Thrills and chills, I replied, rolling my eyes. You havent heard anything about Mom and Dad, have you?  He stared at me as if he didnt remember who they were. Then he shook his head. Not yet. Isnt this a great camp? Did we luck out, or what? I didnt reply. My eyes were on the next table. I thought I had spotted Dierdre. But it was just another girl with streaky blond hair. Have you won any coins yet? Elliot asked. He had a mouth full of waffle. Syrup dripped down his chin. Not yet, I replied. He snickered. They should change the camp slogan for you, Wendy. Only The Worst Elliot laughed. The other boys at the table laughed, too. As I said, Elliot really cracks himself up. I wasnt in the mood for his lame jokes. My mind was still on Dierdre. Catch you later, I said. I squeezed past the table and headed toward the girls side of the room. Cheers and laughter rang out at a table near the wall. A scrambled-egg tossing battle had broken out. Three counselors rushed to stop it. Jan and Ivys table was full. I found an empty space at the next table. I poured myself a glass of juice and a bowl of cornflakes. But I didnt feel too hungry. Hey— I called out when I saw Buddy walk by. He didnt hear me over the noise, so I jumped up and ran after him. Hi. Whats up? He greeted me with a smile. His blond hair was still wet from the shower. He smelled kind of flowery. Aftershave, I guessed. Do you know where Dierdre went? I demanded. He narrowed his eyes in surprise. Dierdre? A girl in my dorm room, I explained. She didnt come back to the room last night. Her closet is empty. Dierdre, he repeated, thinking hard. He raised his clipboard to his face and ran his finger down it slowly. Oh, yeah. Shes gone. His cheeks turned bright pink. Excuse me? I stared up at him. Dierdre is gone? Where did she go? Home? He studied the sheet on his clipboard. I guess. It just says shes gone. His cheeks darkened from pink to red. Thats so weird, I told him. She didnt say good-bye or anything. Buddy shrugged. A smile spread over his face. Have a nice day He started toward the counselors table at the front of the huge room. But I ran after him. I grabbed his arm. Buddy, one more question, I said. Do you know where I can find a little girl named Alicia? Buddy waved to some boys across the room. Go get em, guys Only The Best he shouted to them. Then he turned back to me. Alicia? I dont know her last name. Shes probably six or seven, I told him. She has beautiful, long red hair and a face full of freckles. Alicia  He chewed his bottom lip. Then he raised the clipboard again. I watched as he ran his finger down the list of names. When his finger stopped, his cheeks turned pink again.  Oh, yeah. Alicia, he said, lowering the clipboard. He grinned at me. A strange grin. A chilling grin. Shes gone, too. Jan Ivy I saw them hurrying from the mess hall, and I chased after them. Weve got to talk I cried breathlessly. We cant. Were late. Jan straightened her bangs with one hand. If we dont get to the volleyball nets in time, we cant be in the tournament. But its important I called as they jogged to the doors. They didnt seem to hear me. I watched them disappear into the morning sunlight. My heart pounded in my chest. I suddenly felt cold all over. I caught up with my brother, who was playfully boxing a tall, skinny boy with short blond hair. Elliot—come here, I instructed. Just for a minute. I cant, he called. Remember? My one-on-one contest? The tall, skinny boy hurried out the door. I stepped in front of Elliot, blocking his path. Give me a break he cried. I dont want to be late. Im going against Jeff. Remember him? I can beat him. Hes big, but hes real slow. Elliot, something strange is going on here, I said, backing him against the wall. Kids were staring at us as they made their way outside. But I didnt care. Youre the only one whos strange Elliot shot back. Are you going to let me go to the basketball court or not? He started to push past me. I pinned his shoulders to the wall with both hands. Just give me one second I insisted. Theres something wrong with this camp, Elliot. I let go of him. You mean the rumbling noises? he asked, brushing back his dark hair with one hand. Thats just gas under the ground or something. A counselor explained it to me. Thats not what Im talking about, I replied. Kids are disappearing. He laughed. Invisible kids? You mean like a magic trick? Stop making fun of me I snapped. It isnt funny, Elliot. Kids are disappearing. Dierdre from my dorm room? She was in the Winners Walk last night. Then she didnt come back to the room. Elliots grin faded. This morning, Buddy told me she was gone, I continued. I snapped my fingers. Just like that. And a little girl named Alicia—she disappeared, too. Elliots brown eyes studied me. Kids have to go home sometime, he insisted. Whats the big deal?  And what about Mom and Dad? I demanded. They couldnt have driven very far before they realized the trailer had come loose. Why havent they found us? Why hasnt the camp found them? Elliot shrugged. Beats me, he replied casually. He dodged past me and started to the door. Wendy, youre just unhappy because you stink at sports. But Im having a great time here. Dont mess it up for me—okay? But—but—Elliot— I sputtered. Shaking his head, he pushed the door open with both hands and escaped into the sunlight. I balled both hands into tight fists. I really wanted to pound him. Why wouldnt he listen to me? Couldnt he see how upset and frightened I was? Elliot is the kind of kid who never worries about anything. Everything always seems to go his way. So why should he sweat it? But youd think hed be just a little worried about Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad  I had a heavy feeling in my stomach as I made my way slowly out the door. Had they been in a car accident or something? Is that why they hadnt found Elliot and me yet? No. Stop making things worse, I scolded myself. Dont let your imagination run away with you, Wendy. I suddenly remembered my plan to call home. Yes, I decided, I will do that right now. I will call home and leave a message for Mom and Dad on the answering machine. I stopped in the middle of the path and searched for a pay phone. A group of girls carrying hockey sticks passed by. I heard a long whistle coming from the pool across from the tennis courts. Then I heard the splash of kids diving into the water. Everyone is having fun, I thought—except me. I decided to make the call, then find a sport to play. Something to take my mind off all my crazy worries. I returned to the row of blue and white pay phones at the side of the lodge. I ran full speed and picked up the nearest phone. I raised the receiver to my ear and started to punch in our number. Then I cried out in surprise. Hi there, Camper boomed a cheerful, deep voice. Have a wonderful day at camp. This is King Jellyjam greeting you. Work hard. Play hard. And win. And always remember—Only The Best Oh, no I cried. A stupid message— Hi there, Camper Have a wonderful day— The tape started to repeat in my ear. I slammed the receiver down and picked up the next phone. Hi there, Camper Have a wonderful day at camp. The same jolly, booming voice. The same recorded message. I tried every phone in the row. They all played the same message. None of the phones were real. Where are the real phones? I wondered. There have to be phones that actually work. I turned away from the lodge and wandered down the dirt path. As I passed the bushes where Jan, Ivy, and I had hid last night, I felt a chill. And thought about Alicia. Bright sunlight washed over the sloping, grassy hill. I shielded my eyes and watched a black-and-gold monarch butterfly. It fluttered toward a patch of red and pink geraniums. I walked aimlessly, searching for a telephone. All around, kids were shouting, laughing, playing hard. I didnt really hear them. I was deep into my own troubled thoughts. Hey Hey Hey My brothers voice startled me into stopping. I blinked several times, struggling to focus. I saw that I had wandered down to the basketball court. Elliot and Jeff were having their one-on-one basketball competition. Jeff dribbled the ball. It thudded loudly on the asphalt court. My brother waved both arms in Jeffs face. Made a grab for the ball. Missed. Jeff lowered his shoulder. Bumped Elliot out of the way. Dribbled to the basket— and shot. Two points he cried, grinning. Elliot scowled and shook his head. You fouled me. Jeff pretended not to hear. He was twice as big as Elliot. A big hulk. He could push Elliot all over the court, if he wanted to. Whatever made Elliot think he could win?  Whats the score? Jeff demanded, wiping sweat off his forehead with the back of one hand. Eighteen to ten, Elliot reported unhappily. I didnt need twenty guesses to figure out that my brother was losing. The basketball court was closed off by a mesh-wire fence. I grabbed the fence with both hands, pressed my face up against it, and watched. Elliot dribbled, moving back, back, giving himself some space. Jeff moved with him, leaning forward, adjusting his basketball shorts with one hand as he moved. Suddenly, Elliot burst forward, his eyes on the basket. He started his jump, raised his right hand to shoot—and Jeff grabbed the ball away. Elliot jumped and shot nothing but air. Jeff dribbled twice. Put up a two-handed layup. Swish. The score was twenty to ten. Jeff won the game a few seconds later. He let out a cheer and slapped Elliot a high five. Elliot frowned and shook his head. Lucky shots, he muttered. Yeah. For sure, Jeff replied, using the front of his sleeveless blue T-shirt to mop his sweating face. Hey, congratulate me, man. Youre my sixth victim Huh? Elliot stared at him, hands pressed against his knees, struggling to catch his breath. You mean—? Yeah. Jeff grinned. My sixth King Coin. I get to march in the Winners Walk tonight Wow. Thats cool, Elliot replied without enthusiasm. I still have three coins to go. I had the sudden feeling that I was being watched. I let go of the wire fence and took a step back. Buddy had been staring at me from the path. His eyes were narrowed, and his mouth was set in a stern, unhappy expression. How long had he been standing there? Why did he look so unhappy? His grim expression gave me a chill. As I turned to him, he stepped forward. His blue eyes stared hard into mine. Im sorry, Wendy, the counselor said softly. But you have to go. Excuse me? I gaped at him. My mouth dropped open. What was he saying? Where did I have to go? Did he mean I had to go—like Dierdre and Alicia? You have to go find a sport, Buddy repeated, still speaking softly. His solemn expression didnt change. You cant stand around watching other kids play. King Jellyjam would never approve of that. Id like to step on that ugly little blob I thought angrily. What a stupid name. King Jellyjam. Yuck Buddy had just scared me to death. Was he trying to frighten me? I wondered. No, I quickly decided. Buddy doesnt know that Im upset about things. How could he know? Buddy hurried on to the basketball court. He slapped Jeff on the back and handed him a gold King Coin. Way to go, guy he cried, flashing Jeff a thumbs-up. Ill see you in the Winners Walk tonight. Only The Best Buddy said a few words to my brother. Elliot shrugged a few times. Then he said something that made Buddy laugh. I couldnt hear their words. When Elliot trotted off to find his next sport, Buddy strode quickly back to me. He put an arm around my shoulders and guided me away from the basketball court. I guess youre just not a self-starter, Wendy, he said. I guess, I replied. What was I supposed to say? Well, Im going to give you a schedule for today. See if you like it, Buddy said. First, I have a tennis match fined up for you. You play tennis, right? A little, I told him. Im not that great, but— After tennis, come down to the softball diamond, okay? Buddy continued. Well get you on one of the softball teams. He flashed me a warm smile. I think youll have a lot more fun if you join in— dont you? Yeah. Probably, I replied. I wanted to sound more enthusiastic. But I just couldnt. Buddy led me onto one of the back tennis courts. An African-American girl about my age was warming up by hitting a tennis ball against a backboard. She turned and greeted me as I approached. Hows it going? Fine, I replied. We introduced ourselves. Her name was Rose. She was tall and pretty. She wore a purple tank top over black shorts. I saw a silver ring dangling from one ear. Buddy handed me a racket. Have fun, he said. And watch out, Wendy. Rose already has five King Coins  Are you a good tennis player? I asked, twirling the racket in my hand. Rose nodded. Yeah. Pretty good. How about you? I dont know, I told her honestly. My friend and I always play just for fun. Rose laughed. She had a deep, throaty laugh that I liked. It made me want to laugh, too. I never play for fun she declared. She told the truth. We volleyed back and forth for a while, to get warmed up. Rose leaned forward, tensed her body, narrowed her dark eyes—then started slamming the ball back at me as if we were playing the final set of a championship She played even harder once we started our match. I found out very quickly that I was no match for her. I was lucky to return a few of her serves Rose was a good sport about it. I caught her snickering a few times at my twohanded backhand. But she didnt make fun of my pitiful game. And she gave me some really helpful tips as the match continued. She won in straight sets. I congratulated her. She seemed really excited about winning her sixth King Coin. A woman counselor I hadnt seen before appeared on the court and presented the coin to Rose. See you at the Winners Walk tonight, she said, grinning. Then the counselor turned to me. The softball diamond is right over that hill, Wendy. She pointed. I thanked her and began walking in that direction. Dont walk—run she called. Lets see some spirit Only The Best I let out an unhappy groan. I dont think she heard me. Then I obediently started to run. Why was everyone always rushing me around here? I complained silently. Why cant I go lie down by the pool and work on my tan? As the softball diamond came into view, I started to cheer up a little. I actually like softball. Im not much of a fielder. But Im a pretty good slugger. The teams, I saw, had boys and girls on them. I recognized two of the girls from my breakfast table this morning. One of them tossed me a bat. Hi. Im Ronni. You can be on our team, she said. Can you pitch? I guess, I replied, wrapping my hands around the bat. Sometimes I pitch after school on the playground. She nodded. Okay. You can pitch the first couple of innings. Ronni called the other kids together and we huddled. We went around the circle, giving our names. Then the kids who didnt have fielding positions chose their spots. If we win, do we all get King Coins? a boy with a fake tattoo of an eagle on his shoulder asked. Yes. All of us, Ronni told him. Everyone cheered. Dont start cheering yet. Weve got to win first Ronni exclaimed.  She went around the circle, giving the batting order. Since I was the pitcher, I batted ninth. But since I had a bat, I decided to take a few practice swings. I stepped away from the others, behind the third base line. Easing my hands up on the bat, I took a soft swing. I like to choke up pretty high. Im not very strong, and it gives me a harder swing. The bat felt pretty good. I took a few more soft swings. Then I pulled it behind my shoulder—and swung as hard as I could. I didnt see Buddy standing there. The bat smacked him hard in the chest. It made a sickening thocccck as it crashed into his ribs. I let the bat fall from my hands. Then I staggered back. Stunned. Horrified. Buddys smile faded. He narrowed his blue eyes at me. He raised a hand and pointed a finger at me. I like the way you choke up, he said. But maybe we could find you a lighter bat. Huh? My mouth hung open. I couldnt move. I stood there, gaping at him. Buddy—? He picked up the bat from the ground. Does it feel comfortable? Let me see you swing again, Wendy. He handed the bat to me. My hands trembled as I took it from him. I kept my eyes on him. Waited for him to cry out. To grab his chest and collapse in a heap on the ground. Some of the aluminum bats are lighter'

const ad = 'he said. He brushed back his blond hair with one hand. Go ahead. Swing again. I took a few shaky steps away from him. I wanted to make sure I didnt hit him again. Then I choked up on the bat and swung. How is it? he asked. F-fine, I stammered. He flashed me a thumbs-up and went to talk to Ronni. Whoa I thought. What is the story here? I swung that bat into his chest, hard enough to break a few ribs. Or at least knock his breath out. But Buddy didnt even seem to notice What is the story here? I told Jan and Ivy about it at dinner. Jan snickered. I guess your swing isnt as hard as you think. But it made a horrible sound Like eggs breaking or something I exclaimed. And he just went on smiling and talking. He probably waited until he was out of sight. Then he screamed his head off Ivy suggested. I forced myself to laugh along with my two friends. But I didnt feel like laughing. It was all too strange. I mean, no one could take a blow like that right in the chest and not even say Ouch Our team lost by ten points. But after that thocccck, who could think about the game?  I glanced across the room to the counselors table. Buddy sat at one end, talking and laughing with Holly. He seemed perfectly okay. I kept glancing at him all through dinner. Again and again, I heard the sickening thocccck the bat made as it smashed into his chest. I just couldnt get it out of my mind. I kept thinking about it as we trooped out to the track after dinner for the Winners Walk. It was a windy night. The torches flickered and nearly went out. The trees around the track shivered and bent. Their branches seemed to reach down for the ground. The marching music started, and the winners paraded by. Rose waved to me as she passed. I saw Jeff walking proudly near the back of the line, his gold coins jangling around his neck. After the ceremony, I hurried back to the room and climbed into bed. Too many troubling thoughts whirred around in my brain. I wanted to go to sleep and shut them out. The next morning at breakfast, Rose and Jeff were gone. I searched for Rose and Jeff. And I searched for my brother all morning. I knew hed be playing hard at one of the sports. But I walked from the soccer field at one end of the camp to the driving range at the other end, and I didnt see him. Had Elliot disappeared, too? The frightening thought kept tugging at my mind. Weve got to get out of this camp I kept repeating those words to myself as I made my way along the crisscrossing dirt paths. King Jellyjam, the little purple blob, grinned at me from the signs posted everywhere. Even his cartoon smile gave me the creeps. Something was terribly wrong at King Jellyjams Sports Camp. And the more I walked, my eyes searching every face for my brother, the more frightened I became. Buddy caught up to me after lunch. He led me back to the Softball diamond. Wendy, you cant leave your team, he said sternly. Forget yesterday. You still have a chance. If you win today, you guys all win King Coins. I didnt want any King Coins. I wanted to see my parents. I wanted to see my brother. And I wanted to get out of there I didnt pitch today. I played left field, which gave me plenty of time to think. I planned our escape. It wont be that hard, I decided. Elliot and I will sneak out after dinner when everyone is watching the Winners Walk. Well make our way down the hill, back to the highway. Then well walk or hitchhike to the nearest town with a police station. I knew the police would find Mom and Dad for us easily. A simple plan, right? Now all I had to do was find Elliot. Our team lost the game seven to nine. I grounded out to end the game. The other kids were disappointed that the team lost, but I didnt really care. I still hadnt won a single King Coin. As we trotted toward our dorms, I saw Buddy watching me. He had a fretful expression on his face. Wendy—whats your next sport? he called to me. I pretended I didnt hear him and trotted away. My next sport is running, I thought unhappily. Running away from this horrible place. The ground began to rumble and shake as I passed the main lodge. This time, I ignored it and kept walking to the dorm.  I didnt find Elliot until after dinner. I saw him heading out the mess-hall door with two buddies. They were laughing, talking loudly, and bumping each other with their chests as they walked. Elliot I called, chasing after him. Hey, Elliot—wait up He turned away from his two friends. Oh. Hi, he said. Hows it going? Did you forget you have a sister? I demanded angrily. He narrowed his eyes at me. Excuse me? Where have you been? I asked. A grin spread over his face. Winning these, he said. He raised the chain around his neck to show off the gold King Coins he was wearing. Ive got five. Awesome, I said sarcastically. Elliot—weve got to get out of here Huh? Get out? He twisted up his face, confused. Yes, I insisted. We have to get away from this camp—tonight I cant, Elliot replied. No way. Kids pushed past us, on their way to watch the Winners Walk. I followed Elliot out the mess-hall door. Then I pulled him off the path, onto the grass at the side of the building. You cant leave? Why not? I demanded. Not till I win my sixth coin, he said. He jangled the coin necklace in my face. Elliot—this place is dangerous I cried. And Mom and Dad must be— Youre just jealous, he interrupted. He jangled the coins again. You havent won any—have you I balled my hands into fists. I wanted to strangle him. I really did. He was such a competitive jerk. He always had to win everything. I took a deep breath and tried to speak calmly. Elliot, arent you at all worried about Mom and Dad? He lowered his eyes for a moment. A little. Well, we have to get out of here and find them I declared. Tomorrow, he replied. After the track meet in the morning. After I win my sixth coin. I opened my mouth to argue with him. But what was the point? I knew how stubborn my brother can be. If he wanted to win that sixth coin, he wouldnt leave till he won it. I couldnt argue with him. And I couldnt drag him away. Right after the track meet tomorrow morning, I told him, were out of here Whether you win or lose. Agreed? He thought about it. Okay. Agreed, he said finally. Then he trotted off to find his friends. Four kids marched in the Winners Walk. As I watched from the sidelines, I thought about the kids I knew who had marched before. Dierdre. Rose. Jeff  Had they all gone home? Were they picked up by their parents? Were they back home now safe and sound?  Maybe Im frightening myself for no reason, I thought. Everyone else in camp seems to be having a great time. Why am I the only worrier? And then I remembered that I wasnt the only worrier. Alicias tear-stained face floated into my mind. What had Alicia seen that had frightened her so much? Why was she desperately trying to warn us to get away? Ill probably never find out, I told myself. When the Winners Walk ceremony ended, I didnt feel like going back to the dorm. I knew I couldnt get to sleep. Too many thoughts troubled my mind. As the other kids made their way to their rooms, I ducked into the deep shadows. Then I sneaked along the path to the sloping hill that led up to the main lodge. Hiding behind a wide evergreen shrub, I dropped down onto the grass. It was a cool, cloudy night. The air felt heavy and damp. I raised my eyes to the sky. Clouds covered the stars and the moon. Far in the distance, I could see tiny red lights moving slowly against the blackness. An airplane. I wondered where it was headed. Crickets began to chirp. The wind rustled my hair. I gazed up at the starless sky. Trying to relax. Trying to calm myself down. After a few minutes, I heard voices. Footsteps. I pulled myself up to my knees and ducked low behind the shrub. The voices grew louder. A girl laughed. Carefully, I peered out from between the piney branches. I saw two counselors, walking rapidly along the path that led up the hill. Behind them, I spotted another group of counselors making their way quickly up the hill. They all seemed to be in a hurry. I lowered myself behind the shrub and hid in the darkness. Theyre heading to the lodge, I decided. Must be some kind of counselors meeting. Their white shorts and T-shirts were easy to see, even on such a dark night. Keeping out of sight, I watched them make their way up the path. But to my surprise, they didnt go to the lodge. Several yards from the lodge entrance, they turned off the path and ducked into the woods. Where were they going? I saw two more groups of counselors make their way into the trees. There must be a hundred counselors at this camp, I realized. And theyre all going into the woods tonight. I waited until I thought all of the counselors had passed by. Then I slowly pulled myself to my feet. I stared into the woods. But I could see only darkness. Shadows upon shadows. I ducked back down when I heard two more voices. Peering through the evergreen branches, I spied Holly and Buddy. They were taking long strides, walking side by side. I waited till they passed by. Then I jumped up.  Creeping in the deep shadows, I followed them into the woods. I didnt stop to worry about getting caught. I had to know where the counselors were all going. Buddy and Holly moved quickly through the woods, pushing tall weeds out of their way, stepping over fallen tree limbs. To my surprise, a low, white structure came into view. It appeared to glow dully in the dim light. The building was built low to the ground. The top was curved. I squinted at it through the trees. It looks like an igloo, I thought. What is this strange building? I wondered. Why is it hidden away in the trees? A dark opening had been cut into the side. Holly ducked into the low entrance. Buddy followed her in. I waited nearly a minute. Then I stepped up to the opening. My heart pounded. Such a strange, little building. Round and smooth as ice. I hesitated. I peered into the entrance, but couldnt see anything inside. I didnt hear any voices. What should I do? I asked myself. Should I go in? Yes. I took a deep breath and lowered myself into the opening. Three steep steps led down to a dim entryway. A single red light down near the floor gave off the only light. I stepped into the dark red glow, then stopped and listened. I could hear voices speaking softly in the next room. Trailing my hand along the bare, concrete wall, I moved slowly toward the voices. An open doorway came up on my right. I stopped outside it. Then I slowly, carefully peered in. I stared into a large, square room. Four torches hanging at the front of the room sent out flickering orange light. The counselors sat on long wooden benches, facing a low stage. A purple banner hung over the stage. It proclaimed: ONLY THE BEST. Its a little theater, I realized. Some kind of meeting hall. But why is it hidden away in the woods? And why are the counselors all meeting here tonight? I didnt have to wait long for my answer. Buddy stepped on to the small stage. He walked quickly into the flickering orange torchlight. Then he turned to face the audience of counselors.'

const ae = 'I crept into the doorway. There were no torches in the back of the hall. It was pitch-black back there. Walking on tiptoe, I edged my way along the back wall. The door to a closet of some kind stood open. I ducked into it. Buddy raised both hands. The counselors instantly stopped talking. They all sat up straight and stared forward at him. Time to refresh ourselves, Buddy called out. His voice echoed off the concrete walls. The counselors sat stiffly. No one moved. No one made a sound. Buddy pulled a gold coin from his pocket. A King Coin, I figured. It dangled on a long gold chain. Time to refresh our minds, Buddy said. Time to refresh our mission. He raised the gold coin high. It glowed in the torchlight as he began to swing it. Back and forth. Slowly. Clear your minds, he instructed them, speaking softly now. Clear your minds, as I have cleared mine. The gleaming gold coin swung slowly back and forth. Back and forth. Clear  clear  clear your minds, Buddy chanted. He is hypnotizing them I realized. Buddy is hypnotizing all the counselors. And hes been hypnotized, too  I took a step forward. I couldnt believe what I was seeing and hearing Clear your minds to serve the master Buddy declared. For that is why we are here. To serve the master in all his glory To serve the master the counselors all chanted back together. Who is the master? I asked myself. What are they talking about? Buddy continued chanting out slogans to the crowd of counselors. His eyes were wide. He never blinked. We do not think he shouted. We do not feel We give ourselves up to serve the master And suddenly I had an answer to some of my questions. Now I knew why Buddy hadnt cried out, hadnt collapsed to the ground when I swung the bat into his chest. He had hypnotized away all feeling. He was in some kind of trance. He couldnt feel the bat. He couldnt feel anything. Only The Best Buddy cried, raising both fists into the air. Only The Best the counselors all repeated. Their unblinking faces appeared strange, frozen in the flickering orange light. Only The Best Only The Best They all chanted the slogan over and over. Their voices echoed loudly off the walls. Only their mouths moved. Like puppets. Only The Best can serve the master Buddy shouted. Only The Best the counselors chanted one more time. Buddy had been swinging the gold coin over his head during the entire performance. Now he lowered it back into the pocket of his shorts. The room grew silent. A heavy silence. An eerie silence. And then I sneezed. I cupped my hand over my mouth. Too late. I sneezed again. Buddys mouth opened wide in surprise. He jabbed a finger in the air, pointing at me. Several counselors jumped to their feet and spun around. I turned to the door. Could I escape through it before one of them caught me? No. No way I could get over there. My legs were shaking. But I forced myself to move. I backed against the wall. Why had I stepped so far into the room? Why hadnt I stayed in the safety of the doorway? Whos there? I heard Buddy call. Its so dark. Who is it? Good I thought. He didnt know it was me. But in seconds, theyd grab me and drag me into the light. I took another step back. Another. Darkness fell over me. I spun around. Ohh I cried out when I saw that I had nearly toppled down a steep stairway. It wasnt a closet after all. Black stone steps curved sharply down. Where did they lead? I couldnt guess. But I had no choice. The steps were my only chance of escape. I leaned against the wall and plunged down the stairs. My shoes slid on the smooth stones. I nearly tripped and went sailing head first. But I grabbed the wall and steadied myself as I started to fall. The stairs curved down. Down. The air grew hot and sour. I held my breath. The air smelled like sour milk. A strange, deep moan rumbled up from down below. I stopped to catch my breath. Listened hard. The low moan rolled up the stairway again. A whiff of sour air invaded my nostrils. I turned back. Was I being followed? Had the counselors seen me escape through the open door?  No. It had been too dark. I didnt hear anyone on the stairs. They werent following me. What smelled so bad down below? I wanted to stop right there. I didnt want to climb down any farther. But what choice did I have? I knew theyd be searching for me upstairs. Leaning a hand against the stone wall, I made my way down. The stairway led into a long, narrow tunnel. I could see pale light at the end of it. Another deep moan rumbled in the distance. The floor shook. I took a long breath and passed quickly through the tunnel. The air grew hot and damp. My shoes splashed through puddles on the tunnel floor. Where does this lead? I wondered. Will it take me back outside? As I neared the end of the tunnel, a whiff of sour air made me choke. I coughed and struggled to stop my stomach from heaving. What a disgusting smell Like decayed meat and rotten eggs. Like garbage left out in the sun for days and days. I pressed both hands over my mouth. The odor was so strong, I could taste it I gagged. Once. Twice. Dont think about the smell I ordered myself. Think about something else. Think about fresh flowers. Think about sweet-smelling perfume. Somehow, I calmed my stomach. Then, pinching two fingers over my nose to keep the odor out'

const af = 'I stumbled to the end of the tunnel. I stopped as the tunnel gave way to a huge, brightly lit chamber. I stopped and stared—at the ugliest, most frightening thing I had ever seen in my life Squinting into the bright light, I saw dozens of kids with mops, and buckets, and water hoses. At first, I thought they were cleaning off a giant, purple balloon. Bigger than any balloon in the Thanksgiving Day parade But as the water sprayed over it and the mops soaped its sides, the balloon let out a loud groan. And I realized I wasnt staring at a balloon. It was a creature. And the creature was alive. I was staring at a monster. I was staring at King Jellyjam. Not a cute little mascot. But a fat, gross, purple mound of slime, nearly as big as a house. Wearing a gold crown. Two enormous, watery yellow eyes rolled around in his head. He smacked his fat purple lips and groaned again. Hunks of thick, white goo dripped from his huge, hairy nostrils. The disgusting odor rolled off his body. Even holding my nose couldnt keep out the sour stench. He smelled like dead fish, rotting garbage, sour milk, and burning rubber—all at once The gold crown bounced on top of his slimy, wet head. His purple stomach heaved, as if an ocean wave was breaking inside him. And he let out a putrid burp that shook the walls. The kids—dozens of them—worked frantically. They circled the ugly monster. They hosed him down. Scrubbed his body with mops and sponges and brushes. And as they worked, little round objects rained down on them. Click. Click. Click. The little round things clattered to the floor. Snails Snails popping out through King Jellyjams skin. I started to gag again when I realized the hideous creature was sweating snails I staggered back into the tunnel, pressing my hands over my mouth. How could those kids stand the horrible, sour stench? Why were they washing him? Why were they working so hard? I gasped when I recognized some of the kids. Alicia She held a hose with both hands and sprayed King Jellyjams bulging, heaving stomach. Her red hair was soaked and matted to her forehead. She cried as she worked, bawling loudly. I saw Jeff. Rubbing a mop up and down on the monsters side.  I opened my mouth to call to Alicia and Jeff. But my breath caught in my throat, and no sound came out. And then someone came running toward me. Stumbling and staggering. Into the tunnel. Out of the bright light. Dierdre A dripping sponge in one fist. Her streaky blond hair drenched. Her clothes wrinkled and soaked. Dierdre I managed to choke out. Get away from here she cried. Wendy—run But—but— I sputtered. What is happening? Why are you doing this? Dierdre uttered a sob. Only The Best she whispered. Only The Best get to be King Jellyjams slaves Huh? I gaped at her as she trembled in front of me, shivering from the cold water that had drenched her. Dont you see? Dierdre cried. These are all winners. All six-coin winners. He gets the strongest kids. The best workers. But—why? I demanded. Snails popped through the creatures skin and clicked as they hit the hard floor. A wave of sour stench blew over us as another rumbling burp escaped his swollen lips. Why are you all washing him? I asked Dierdre. He—he has to be washed all the time Dierdre exclaimed with a sob. He has to be kept wet. And he cant stand his own smell. So he gets the strongest kids down here. And makes us wash him night and day. But, Dierdre— I started. If we stop washing, she continued. If we try to take a rest, he—hell eat us Her entire body shook. He—he ate three kids today No I cried, gasping in horror. Hes so disgusting Dierdre wailed. Those horrible snails popping out of his body  that putrid smell. She grabbed my arm. Her hand was wet and cold. The counselors are all hypnotized, she whispered. King Jellyjam has total control over them. I—I know, I told her. Get out of here Hurry Dierdre pleaded, squeezing my arm. Get help, Wendy. Please— An angry roar made us both jump. Oh, no Dierdre wailed. Hes seen us Its too late The monster let out another roar. Dierdre loosened her grip on my arm. We both turned toward him, shaking with fright. He was bellowing at the ceiling, roaring just to keep everyone terrified. His watery yellow eyes were shut. He hadnt seen Dierdre and me—yet. Get help Dierdre whispered to me. Then she raised the sponge and ran back to her place at King Jellyjams side. I froze for a moment. Froze in horror. In disbelief. Another rumbling burp jolted me from my thoughts and sent me scurrying through the tunnel. At least now I knew why the camp ground shook so often The sour stench followed me through the tunnel and back up the curving, stone steps. I wondered if I could ever get rid of it. I wondered if I could ever breathe freely again. How can I help those kids? I asked myself. What can I do? I was too terrified to think clearly. As I ran through the darkness, I could picture King Jellyjam smacking his gross purple lips. I could see him rolling his yellow eyes. And the ugly black snails squeezing out through his skin. I felt sick as I reached the top of the stairs. But I knew I didnt have time to worry about myself. I had to save the kids who had been forced to be the monsters slaves. And I had to save the rest of the kids in camp—before they became slaves, too. I poked my head out of the closet door. The four torches still burned at the front of the small theater. But the room was empty. Where were the counselors? Out searching for me? Probably. Where can I go? I asked myself. I cant spend the night in this closet. I have to breathe some fresh air. I have to go somewhere where I can think. Carefully, I made my way out of the low igloo. Into the starless night. Hiding behind a wide tree trunk, my eyes searched the woods. Narrow beams of white light from flashlights darted through the trees, over the ground. Yes, I told myself. The counselors are searching for me. I backed up, away from the crisscrossing lights. Trying not to make a sound, I crept between the trees and tall weeds, toward the path that led to the lodge. Can I get to the dorms and warn everyone? I wondered. Will anyone believe me? Will there be counselors guarding the dorms? Waiting for me to show up?  I heard voices on the path. I ducked behind a tree and let two counselors pass. Their flashlights made wide circles over the sloping hill. As soon as they were out of sight, I darted out from the trees. I ran down the hill. Keeping in deep shadows, I made my way past the swimming pool. Past the tennis courts. All dark and silent now. A clump of tall hedges beside the track would hide me from all sides, I realized. I ducked behind the hedges, gasping for breath. Dropping to my knees, I crawled into their shelter. I settled myself on the prickly pine needles beneath the hedges. And peered out. Only darkness now. I took a deep breath. Then another. Such sweet-smelling air. Ive got to think, I told myself. Got to think  Shouting voices startled me awake. When had I fallen asleep? Where was I? I blinked several times. Sat up and stretched. My body felt stiff. My back ached. Every muscle ached. I gazed around. Discovered I was still hidden inside the hedges. A gray, cloudy morning. The sun trying to burn through the high clouds. And the voices? Cheers? I raised myself up and peered through the hedges. The track competition It had just begun. I saw six boys in shorts and T-shirts, leaning forward as they ran around the track. A crowd of kids and counselors cheering them on. And in the lead? Elliot No I cried hoarsely, my voice still choked with sleep. I stepped out from the hedges. Made my way across the grass toward the track. I knew I had to stop him. I couldnt let him win the race. I couldnt let him win his sixth coin. If he did, theyd make Elliot a slave, too He ran hard. He pulled far out in front of the other five. What could I do? What? In my panic, I remembered our signal. My two-fingered whistle. My signal for Elliot to take it easy. Hell hear the whistle and slow down, I told myself.'

const ag =  'I raised two fingers to my mouth. I blew. No sound came out. My mouth was too dry. My heart thudded in my chest. I tried again. No. No whistle. Elliot turned into the last lap. There was no way to stop him from winning now. No way to stop him—unless I beat him there With a desperate cry, I plunged forward and started to run to the track. My shoes pounded the grass. I kept my eyes on Elliot and the finishing line as I ran. Faster. Faster. If only I could fly Loud cheers rang out as Elliot neared the finish. The other five boys were miles behind My shoes thudded onto the asphalt track. My chest felt about to burst. It hurt to breathe. My breath came in loud wheezes. Faster. Faster. I heard cries of surprise as I raced over the track. I plunged up behind Elliot, reached out both hands—and tackled him from behind. We both toppled in a heap, rolling over the hard track, onto the grass. The other boys raced past us to the finish line. Wendy, you jerk Elliot screamed, jumping to his feet. I—cant explain now I shouted back, struggling to breathe, struggling to stop the aching in my chest. I scrambled to my feet and pulled Elliot up. He angrily tried to jerk free. Whyd you do that, Wendy? Why? I saw three counselors running toward me. Hurry— I ordered my brother. I pulled him away. Just hurry I think he saw the terror in my eyes. I think he realized that tackling him was a desperate act. I think he saw how serious I was. Elliot stopped protesting and started to run. I led him over the grass. Up the sloping hill by the lodge. Into the woods. Where are we going? he called breathlessly. Tell me whats happening Youll see in a minute I called back. Get ready for a really bad smell Huh? Wendy—have you totally lost it? I didnt answer. I kept running. I led the way into the woods. To the igloo-shaped building. At the low entrance, I turned back to see if we were being followed. I didnt see anyone. Elliot followed me into the theater. The torches werent lit. It was pitch-black inside. Feeling my way along the back wall, I found the closet door. I pulled it open and led the way down the curving stairs.  Halfway down, the sour odor floated up to greet us. Elliot cried out and cupped both hands over his nose and mouth. It stinks His cry was muffled by his hands. It gets worse, I told him. Try not to think about it. We jogged side by side through the long tunnel. I wished I had time to warn Elliot. I wished I could tell him what he was about to see. But I was desperate to save Dierdre, Alicia, and the others. Gasping from the smell, I burst into King Jellyjams brightly lit chamber. Water from a dozen hoses splashed over the monsters purple body. Kids scrubbed furiously as he sighed and groaned. I saw the startled horror on my brothers face. But I couldnt worry about Elliot now. Hit the floor I screamed at the top of my lungs, cupping my hands into a megaphone. EVERYBODY—HIT THE FLOOR NOW I had a plan. Would it work? The monsters watery yellow eyes grew wide with surprise. His bloated lips parted. I could see two pink tongues dart and coil inside his mouth. A few of the kids dropped their hoses and mops and flattened themselves on the floor. Others turned to stare at me. Stop washing him I cried. Put down your hoses and brushes Stop working And hit the floor Beside me, Elliot uttered gasping sounds. I glimpsed him struggling to keep the sick smell from overpowering him. King Jellyjam let out a furious roar as the rest of the kids obeyed my instructions. Thick, white slime dripped from his nose. His two tongues flicked out between his purple lips. Get flat I screamed to the kids. Stay down And then I saw the monster raise a fat purple arm. With a disgusting groan, he leaned over. His slimy flesh rippled all over his body as he reached out. Reached out to grab Alicia Help Hes going to eat me Alicia shrieked. She started to get up. No I shrieked. Stay down Stay flat With a terrified cry, Alicia dropped back to the floor. King Jellyjam swung his fat hand down. Fumbled it over her. Tried to lift the little girl up. Tried again. Again. But I had figured right The monsters fingers were too big, too clumsy to pick up anyone who lay flat on the floor. King Jellyjam tilted his head back and uttered a roar of disgust. I cupped my hand over my nose as the disgusting odor grew more intense. Snails pop-pop-popped out of his skin. Rolled down his slimy body. Bounced noisily onto the floor. The monster flailed his arms. He leaned down again and struggled to pick up some other kids. But they pressed themselves flat on the floor. He couldnt lift them. He roared again, weaker this time. His eyes rolled wildly in his enormous head. The smell burned my eyes. It swirled around me, surrounded me in its sour stench. King Jellyjam grabbed for a hose. Couldnt pick it up. He slammed his hand into a bucket. Struggled frantically to splash water on himself. I stood trembling. Watching every move. My plan was working. I knew it would work. It had to work The stench grew even stronger. I could taste it. I could smell it on my skin.  King Jellyjam flailed both arms. Frantically, he struggled to wash himself. His roars became groans. His body began to shake. I gasped as he narrowed his eyes at me. He raised a swollen purple finger and pointed. Accusing me He leaned forward. Reached out. Swiped out his enormous hand. I couldnt move. I was too stunned. I shuddered. His hand slid over me. And before I could struggle, he began to tighten his slimy, stinking fingers around my body. Ohhh. I uttered a horrified moan. The fat, wet fingers tightened. Waves of odor rose up around me. I held my breath. But the smell was everywhere. The fingers wrapped themselves tighter. The monster began to lift me off the ground. Raise me toward his gaping mouth. The two tongues darted and flicked. And then the tongues drooped over his purple lips. The fingers loosened their grip. I slid free as King Jellyjam groaned and fell forward. Kids rolled quickly out of the way. King Jellyjam toppled over headfirst. The gold crown bounced away. The monsters body made a loud splat as it spread over the floor. Yes I choked out happily. I was still shaking, still trying to forget the slimy feel of his fingers against my skin. Yes My plan had worked perfectly. The kids stopped washing—and King Jellyjam suffocated from his own foul smell Are you okay? Elliot asked in a trembling voice. I nodded. Yes. I think Im going to be fine. Elliot held his nose. Ill never complain about Dads garden fertilizer again he declared. Cheering and shouting, the other kids climbed to their feet. Thank you Alicia cried, wrapping me in a hug. The others rushed forward to thank me, too. There were lots of hugs, lots of tears as we made our way up to the theater and then out into the woods. We are out of here I cried happily to Elliot. But we all stopped at the edge of the woods when we saw the counselors. They all stood in front of us, dozens of them, side by side in their white shirts and shorts. They had formed a line along the path. And I could see from the hard expressions set on their faces that they had not come to welcome everyone back. As I stared from face to face, Buddy stepped forward. He gave a signal to the other counselors. Dont let them get away he cried. The counselors stepped forward, moving in a line. Their expressions remained hard and threatening. They kept their arms at their sides. They moved stiffly. Like robots. In a trance. They took two more steps. Then a shrill whistle broke the silence. Stop right there Everybody freeze a mans voice boomed. I heard another shrill whistle. I turned to see several blue-uniformed police officers running up the hill. The counselors shook their heads, blinked, uttered soft cries. They made no attempt to run. Where are we? I heard Holly mutter. Whats happening? another counselor asked. They all appeared dazed and confused. The police whistles seemed to have broken the trance that held them. The other kids and I all cheered happily as the officers swarmed up the hill. How did you know we needed help? I called. We didnt, an officer replied. A horrible smell floated into town. We wanted to find out what was causing it. We followed it here I had to laugh. The same smell that had killed the monster had actually saved us kids. We didnt know there was a problem at this camp, an officer announced. Well contact your parents as soon as we can. Elliot and I led the way down the hill. We were so eager to see Mom and Dad The counselors muttered to themselves, gazing around, trying to figure out what had happened. I turned to Buddy as Elliot and I walked past him. Are you feeling better? I asked. He narrowed his blue eyes at me and squinted hard. He didnt seem to be able to focus. Only The Best, he murmured. Only The Best. Elliot and I were never so glad to be home What took you so long to find us? Elliot demanded. Mom and Dad shook their heads.'

const ah = 'The police checked everywhere, trying to find you two, Dad replied. They called the camp several times. The counselor who answered the phone told the police that you werent there. We were so worried, Mom said, biting her bottom lip. So terribly worried. When we found the trailer empty, we didnt know what to think  Well, were home safe and sound now, I replied with a grin. Maybe you two would like to go away to a real camp next summer, Dad said. Uh  no way Elliot and I answered together. Two weeks later, we had a surprise visitor. I opened the door to find Buddy on the front stoop. His blond hair was neatly brushed. He wore chinos, a blue-and-white-striped sportshirt, and a dark blue tie. Im so sorry about what happened at camp, Buddy said. I was still too shocked at seeing him to reply. I just held on to the door and gaped at him. Is Elliot home? Buddy asked. Hi. Elliot stepped up beside me. Buddy Whats up? I brought you this, Buddy replied. He reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a gold coin. Its a King Coin, he told Elliot. You earned it, remember? You actually won the race. Elliot reached out for it. Then stopped. His hand hung in midair. I knew what my brother was thinking. This would be his sixth King Coin. Should he take it? Finally, he grabbed it. Thanks, Buddy, Elliot said. Buddy said good-bye and gave us a wave. Elliot and I watched him get into a car and drive away. Then we closed the door behind us. Are you sure you shouldve taken that? I asked Elliot. Why not? he replied. That purple monster is dead—right? What could happen? Five minutes later, we both smelled the horrible odor at the same time. Yuck Elliot groaned. He swallowed hard. Wendy, wh-whats that smell? he stammered. I—I dont know, I replied in a shaky voice. I heard Mom laugh behind us. We turned to see her standing in the doorway to the kitchen. Whats wrong? she asked. I have a pot of brussels sprouts boiling on the stove The Giving Tree By Shel Silverstein Once there was a tree.... and she loved a little boy. And everyday the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest. He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples. And they would play hide-and-go-seek. And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade. And the boy loved the tree.... very much. And the tree was happy. But time went by. And the boy grew older. And the tree was often alone. Then one day the boy came to the tree and the tree said,  Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy. I am too big to climb and play  said the boy.  I want to buy things and have fun. I want some money? Im sorry,  said the tree,  but I have no money. I have only leaves and apples. Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city. Then you will have money and you will be happy.  And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away. And the tree was happy. But the boy stayed away for a long time.... and the tree was sad. And then one day the boy came back and the tree shook with joy and she said,  Come, Boy, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy. I am too busy to climb trees,  said the boy.  I want a house to keep me warm,  he said.  I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house. Can you give me a house ?  I have no house,  said the tree.  The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy.  And so the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house. And the tree was happy. But the boy stayed away for a long time. And when he came back, the tree was so happy she could hardly speak.  Come, Boy,  she whispered,  come and play. I am too old and sad to play,  said the boy.  I want a boat that will take me far away from here. Can you give me a boat? Cut down my trunk and make a boat,  said the tree.  Then you can sail away... and be happy.  And so the boy cut down her trunk and made a boat and sailed away. And the tree was happy ... but not really. And after a long time the boy came back again.  I am sorry, Boy,  said the tree,  but I have nothing left to give you - My apples are gone. My teeth are too weak for apples,  said the boy.  My branches are gone,  said the tree. You cannot swing on them -  I am too old to swing on branches,  said the boy.  My trunk is gone, said the tree.  You cannot climb -  I am too tired to climb  said the boy.  I am sorry,  sighed the tree.  I wish that I could give you something.... but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump. I am sorry.... I dont need very much now,  said the boy.  just a quiet place to sit and rest. I am very tired. Well,  said the tree, straightening herself up as much as she could,  well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest.  And the boy did. And the tree was happy. The kids in room  were misbehaving again. Spitballs stuck to the ceiling. Paper planes with through the air. They were the worst behaved class in the whole school.  Now settle down,  said Miss Nelson in a sweet voice. But the class would not settle down. They whispered and giggled. They squirmed and made faces. They were even rude during story hour. And they always refused to do their lessons.  Something will have to be done, said Miss Nelson. The next morning Miss Nelson did'

const ai = 'not come to class.  Wow  yelled the kids.  Now we can really act up  They began to make more spitballs and paper planes.  Today lets just be terrible  they said.  Not so fast  hissed an unpleasant voice. A woman in an ugly black dress stood before them.  I am your new teacher, Miss Viola Swamp.  And she rapped her desk with her ruler.  Where is Miss Nelson?  asked the kids.  Never mind that  snapped Miss Swamp.  Open those arithmetic books  Miss Nelsons kids did as they were told. They could see that Miss Swamp was a real witch. She meant business. Right away she put them to work. And she loaded them down with homework.  Well have no story hour today, keep your mouths shut, sit perfectly still and if you misbehave, youll be sorry,  said Miss Swamp. The kids in room  has never worked so hard. Days went by and there was no sign of Miss Nelson. The kids missed Miss Nelson  Maybe we should try to find her,  they said. Some of them went to the police. The detective there listen to their story. He scratched his chin.  Hmmm,  he said.  Hmmm. I think Miss Nelson is missing.  Obviously he would not be of much help. Some other kids went to Miss Nelsons house. The shades were tightly drawn and no one answered the door. In fact the only person they did see with the wicked Miss Viola Swamp, coming up the street.  If she sees us, shell give us more homework.  And they got away just in time.  Maybe something terrible happened to Miss Nelson Maybe she was gobbled up by sharks  said one of the kids. But that didnt seem likely.  Maybe Miss Nelson went to Mars  said another kid. But that didnt seem likely either. I know  exclaimed one.  Maybe Miss Nelsons car was carried off by a swarm of angry butterflies  But that was the least likely of all. The kids in room  became very discouraged. It seemed that Miss Nelson was never coming back. And they would be stuck with Miss Viola Swamp forever. They heard footsteps in the hall.  Here comes the witch,  they whispered.  Hello, children,  someone said in the sweet voice. It was Miss Nelson  Did you miss me?  she asked.  We certainly did  cried all the kids.  Where were you? Thats my little secret,  said Miss Nelson.  How about a story hour? Oh yes  cried the kids. Miss Nelson noticed that during story hour no one was rude or silly.  What brought about this lovely change?  she asked.  Thats our little secret,  said the kids. Back home Miss Nelson took off her coat and hung in the closet (right next to an ugly black dress). When it was time for bed she sang a little song.  Ill never tell,  she said to herself with a smile. The detective is still working on the case, but now hes looking for Miss Viola Swamp SPRING Frog ran up the path to Toads house. He knocked on the front door. There was no answer. Toad, Toad, shouted Frog, wake up. It is spring Blah, said a voice from inside the house. Toad, Toad, cried Frog. The sun is shining The snow is melting. Wake up I am not here, said the voice. Frog walked into the house. It was dark. All the shutters were closed. Toad, where are you? called Frog. Go away, said the voice from a corner of the room. Toad was lying in bed. He had pulled all the covers over his head. Frog pushed Toad out of bed. He pushed him out of the house and onto the front porch. Toad blinked in the bright sun. Help said Toad. I cannot see anything. Dont be silly, said Frog. What you see is the clear warm light of April. And it means that we can begin a whole new year together, Toad. Think of it, said Frog. We will skip through the meadows and run through the woods and swim in the river. In the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars. You can count them, Frog, said Toad. I will be too tired. I am going back to bed. Toad went back into the house. He got into the bed and pulled the covers over his head again. But, Toad, cried Frog, you will miss all the fun Listen, Frog, said Toad. How long have I been asleep? You have been asleep since November, said Frog. Well then, said Toad, a little more sleep will not hurt me. Come back again and wake me up at about half past May. Good night, Frog. But, Toad, said Frog, I will be lonely until then. Toad did not answer. He had fallen asleep. Frog looked at Toads calendar. The November page was still on top. Frog tore off the November page. He tore off the December page. And the January page, the February page, and the March page. He came to the April page. Frog tore off the April page too. Then Frog ran back to Toads bed. Toad, Toad, wake up. It is May now. What? said Toad. Can it be May so soon? Yes, said Frog. Look at your calendar. Toad looked at the calendar. The May page was on top. Why, it is May said Toad as he climbed out of bed. Then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring. THE STORY One day in summer Frog was not feeling well. Toad said, Frog, you are looking quite green. But I always look green, said Frog. I am a frog. Today you look very green even for a frog, said Toad. Get into my bed and rest. Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea. Frog drank the tea, and then he said, Tell me a story while I am resting. All right, said Toad. Let me think of a story to tell you. Toad thought and thought. But he could not think of a story to tell Frog. I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down, said Toad. Perhaps that will help me to think of a story. Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time. But he could not think of a story to tell Frog. Then Toad went into the house and stood on his head. Why are you standing on your head? asked Frog. I hope that if I stand on my head, it will help me to think of a story, said Toad. Toad stood on his head for a long time. But he could not think of a story to tell Frog. Then Toad poured a glass of water over his head. Why are you pouring water over your head? asked Frog. I hope that if I pour water over my head, it will help me to think of a story, said Toad. Toad poured many glasses of water over his head. But he could not think of a story to tell Frog. Then Toad began to bang his head against the wall. Why are you banging your head against the wall? asked Frog. I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough, it will help me to think of a story, said Toad. I am feeling much better now, Toad, said Frog. I do not think I need a story anymore. Then you get out of bed and let me get into it, said Toad, because now I feel terrible. Frog said, Would you like me to tell you a story, Toad? Yes, said Toad, if you know one. Once upon a time, said Frog, there were two good friends, a frog and a toad. The frog was not feeling well. He asked his friend the toad to tell him a story. The toad could not think of a story. He walked up and down on the porch, but he could not think of a story. He stood on his head, but he could not think of a story. He poured water over his head, but he could not think of a story. He banged his head against the wall, but he could not think of a story. Then the toad did not feel so well, and the frog was feeling better. So the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story. The end. How was that, Toad? said Frog. But Toad did not answer. He had fallen asleeh. A Lost Button Toad and Frog went for a long walk. They walked across a large meadow. They walked in the woods. They walked along the river. At last they went back home to Toads house.  O h , d r a t ,  s a i d T o a d. Not only do my feet hurt, but I have lost one of the buttons on my jacket. Dont worry, said Frog. We will go back to all the places where we walked. We will soon find your button. They walked back to the large meadow. They began to look for the button in the tall grass. Here is your button cried Frog. That is not my button, said Toad. That button is black. My button was white. Toad put the black button in his pocket. A sparrow flew down. Excuse me, said the sparrow. Did you lose a button? I found one. That is not my button, said Toad. That button has two holes. My button had four holes. Toad put the button with two holes in his pocket. They went back to the woods and looked on the dark paths. Here is your button, said Frog. That is not my button, cried Toad. That button is small. My button was big. Toad put the small button in his pocket. A raccoon came out from behind a tree. I heard that you were looking for a button, he said. Here is one that I just found. That is not my button wailed Toad. That button is square. My button was round. Toad put the square button in his pocket. Frog and Toad went back to the river. They looked for the button in the mud. Here is your button, said Frog. That is not my button shouted Toad. That button is thin. My button was thick. Toad put the thin button in his pocket. He was very angry. He jumped up and down and screamed, The whole world is covered with buttons, and not one of them is mine Toad ran home and slammed the door. There, on the floor, he saw his white, four-holed, big, round, thick button. Oh, said Toad. It was here all the time. What a lot of trouble I have made for Frog. Toad took all of the buttons out of his pocket. He took his sewing box down from the shelf. Toad sewed the buttons all over his jacket. The next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog. Frog thought that it was beautiful. He put it on and jumped for joy. None of the buttons fell off. Toad had sewed them on very well. A SWIM Toad and Frog went down to the river. What a day for a swim, said Frog. Yes, said Toad. I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit. I dont wear a bathing suit, said Frog. Well, I do, said Toad. must not look at me until I get into the water. Why not? asked Frog. Because I look funny in my bathing suit. That is why, said Toad. Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks. Toad was wearing his bathing suit. Dont peek, he said. Frog and Toad jumped into the water. They swam all afternoon. Frog swam fast and made big splashes. Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes. A turtle came along the riverbank. Frog, tell that turtle to go away, said Toad. I do not want him to see me in my bathing suit when I come out of the river. Frog swam over to the turtle. Turtle, said Frog, you will have to go away. Why should I? asked the turtle. Because Toad thinks that he looks funny in his bathing suit, and he does not want you to see him, said Frog. Some lizards were sitting nearby. Does Toad really look funny in his bathing suit? they asked. A snake crawled out of the grass. If Toad looks funny in his bathing suit, said the snake, then I, for one, want to see him. We want to see him too, said two dragonflies. Me too, said a field mouse. I have not seen anything funny in a long time. Frog swam back to Toad. I am sorry, Toad, he said. Everyone wants to see how you will look. Then I will stay right here until they go away, said Toad. The turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the riverbank. They waited for Toad to come out of the water. Please, cried Frog, please go away But no one went away. Toad was getting colder and colder. He was beginning to shiver and sneeze. I will have to come out of the water, said Toad. I am catching a cold. Toad climbed out of the river. The water dripped out of his bathing suit and down onto his feet. The turtle laughed. The lizards laughed. The snake laughed. The field mouse laughed, and Frog laughed. What are you laughing at, Frog? said Toad. I am laughing at you, Toad, said Frog, because you do look funny in your bathing suit. Of course I do, said Toad. Then he picked up his clothes and went home. THE LETTER Toad was sitting on his front porch. Frog came along and said, What is the matter, Toad? You are looking sad. Yes, said Toad. This is my sad time of day. It is the time when I wait for the mail to come. It always makes me very unhappy. Why is that? asked Frog. Because I never get any mail, said Toad. Not ever? asked Frog. No, never, said Toad. No one has ever sent me a letter. Every day my mailbox is empty. That is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me. Frog and Toad sat on the porch, feeling sad together. Then Frog said, I have to go home now, Toad. There is something that I must do. Frog hurried home. He found a pencil and a piece of paper. He wrote on the paper. He put the paper in an envelope. On the envelope he wrote A LETTER FOR TOAD. Frog ran out of his house. He saw a snail that he knew. Snail, said Frog, please take this letter to Toads house and put it in his mailbox. Sure, said the snail. Right away. Then Frog ran back to Toads house. Toad was in bed, taking a nap=. Toad, said Frog'

const aj = 'I think you should get up and wait for the mail some more. No, said Toad, I am tired of waiting for the mail. Frog looked out of the window at Toads mailbox. The snail was not there yet. Toad, said Frog, you never know when someone may send you a letter. No, no, said Toad. I do not think anyone will ever send me a letter. Frog looked out of the window. The snail was not there yet. But, Toad, said Frog, someone may send you a letter today. Dont be silly, said Toad. No one has ever sent me a letter before, and no one will send me a letter today. Frog looked out of the window. The snail was still not there. Frog, why do you keep looking out of the window? asked Toad. Because now I am waiting for the mail, said Frog. But there will not be any, said Toad. Oh, yes there will, said Frog, because I have sent you a letter. You have? said Toad. What did you write in the letter? Frog said, I wrote Dear Toad, I am glad that you are my best friend. Your best friend, Frog. Oh, said Toad, that makes a very good letter. Then Frog and Toad went out onto the front porch to wait for the mail. They sat there, feeling happy together. Frog and Toad waited a long time. Four days later the snail got to Toads house and gave him the letter from Frog. Toad was very pleased to have it. My name is Nate the Great. I am a detective. My dog, Sludge, is a detective too. Ouch Right now I am a mumbling, bumbling, tripping detective. I have just tripped over a big pile of books that Rosamond left in my house.  Sludge is sniffing them. He has been sniffing them since Rosamond knocked on my door this morning. She was carrying a bunch of books. Three more were piled on her head. Rosamond looked very strange. Rosamond looks strange all the time. I have great news, she said. I have started a book club. I am calling it Rosamonds Ready Readers. But there is trouble in the club. One of the members is trying to wreck my cookbook. Look Rosamond took a book off her head. The other two books fell off. Why are you carrying books on top of your head? I asked. Because Im president of a club now.  These books help me hold my head high and look like a president. I, Nate the Great, knew that I was looking at a very strange president.'

Some are thin The fat one has a yellow hat. And some are fat. Where do they come from? I cant say. But I bet they have come a long, long way. Some are sad. And some are glad. And some are very, very bad. Why are they sad and glad and bad? I do not know. Go ask your dad. Not one of them is like another. Dont ask us why, go ask your mother. This was no time for play. This was no time for fun. This was no time for games. There was work to be done. All the deep, deep, deep snow All that snow had to go. When our mother went down to the town for the day, She said, Somebody has to clean all this away. Somebody, Somebody has to, you see. Then she picked out two somebodies: Sally and me. Well there we were. We were working like that And then who should come up But the CAT IN THE HAT Oh-oh Sally said. Dont you talk to that cat. That cat is a bad one, That Cat in the Hat. He plays lots of bad tricks. Dont you let him come near. You know what he did the last time he was here. Play tricks? laughed the cat. Oh, my my No, no, no I just want to go in To get out of the snow. Keep your mind on your work. You just stay there, you two. I will go in the house and find something to do. Then the cat went right in He was up to no good So I ran in after as fast as I could Do you know where I found him? You know where he was? He was eating a cake in the tub Yes he was The hot water was on and the cold water, too. And I said to the cat, What a bad thing to do But I like to eat cake in a tub, laughed the cat. You should try it sometime, laughed the cat as he sat. And then I got mad. This was no time for fun. I said, Cat You get out There is work to be done. I have no time for tricks. I must go back and dig. I cant have you in here eating cake like a pig You get out of this house We dont want you about Then I shut off the water and let it run out. The water ran out and then I saw THE RING A ring in the tub And, oh boy What a thing A big long pink cat ring It looked like pink ink And I said, Will this ever come off? I dont think Have no fear of that ring laughed the cat in the hat. Why, I can take cat rings off tubs just like that Do you know how he did it? WITH MOTHERS WHITE DRESS Now the tub was all clean, but her dress was a mess Then Sally looked in. Sally saw the dress, too And Sally and I did not know what to do. We should work in the snow but that dress What a spot It may never come off Sally said. It may not Ho Ho, I can make the spot go. The way I take spots off a dress is just so See here laughed the cat. It is not hard at all. The thing that takes spots off a dress is a wall. Then we saw the cat wipe the spot off the dress. Now the dress was all clean but the wall What a mess Oh, wall spots he laughed. Let me tell you some news. To take spots off a wall, all I need is two shoes Whose shoes did he use? I looked and saw whose And I said to the cat, This is very bad news. Now the spot is all over dads 10 dollar shoes But your dad will not know about that, said the cat. He will never find out, laughed the cat in the hat. His $10 shoes will have no spots at all. I will rub them right off on this rug in the hall. But now we have rug spots I yelled. What a day Rug spots What next? Can you take them away? Dont ask me, he laughed. Why, you know that I can Then he picked up the rug and away the cat ran. I can clean up these rug spots before you count three No spots are too hard for a Hat Cat like me He ran into Dads bedroom and then the cat said, It is good that your dad has the right kind of bed. Then he shook the rug CRACK Now the bed had the spot And all I could say was,Now what, Cat? Now what? But the cat stood still. He just looked at the bed. This is not the right kind of bed, the cat said. To take spots off THIS bed will be hard, said the cat. I cant do it alone, said the cat in the hat. It is good I have someone to help me he said. Right here in my hat on the top of my head It is good that I have him here with me today. He helps me a lot, this is  A.  And then  A took the hat off his head. It is good I have someone to help me, he said. This is and I keep him about, and when I need help then I let him out. Then B said, I think we need  . That spot is too much for the A cat and me. But now, have no fear We will clean it away The three of us Come on Take it away yelled  A. I will hit that old spot with this broom Do you see? It comes off the old bed It goes on the T.V. And then  cleaned up the T.V. He cleaned it with milk, put the spot in a pan And then blew it out of the house with a fan But look where it went I said. Look where it blew You blew the mess out of the house. That is true. But now you made Snow Spots You cant let THEM stay Let us think about that now, said. With some help, we can do it said  . Then POP On his head we saw Then, POP POP POP  We will clean up that snow if it takes us all day If it takes us all night, we will clean it away said  They ran out of the house then and we ran out, too. And the big cat laughed, Ha ha, now you will see something new. My cats are all clever. My cats are good shots My cats have good guns, they will kill all those spots. But this did not look very clever to me. Kill snow spots with pop guns? That just couldnt be. All this does is make more spots, we yelled at the cat. Your cats are no good. Put them back in your hat. Take your  Put them back in your hat and take them away Oh, no said the cat. All they need is more help. Help is all that they need. So keep still and dont yelp. Then Little  took the hat off his head. I have  H here to help us he said. But our work is so hard We must have more than them. We need . Come on Get rid of those spots said the cats. Get rid of the mess And they jumped at the snow with long rakes and red bats. They put it in pails and they made high pink hills Pink snow men Pink snow balls And little pink pills Oh, the things that they did and they did them so hard. It was all one big spot now all over the yard But the Big Cat stood there and he said, This is good. This is what they should do and I knew that they would. With a little more help all the work will be done. They need one more cat and I know just the one. Look close in my hand. I have  On his head are Cats is too small to see so dont try. You cannot. But  is the cat who will clean up that spot Now here is the  you cant see, said the cat. And I bet you cant guess what he has in his hat. He has something called VOOM. VOOM is so hard to get You never saw anything like it, I bet. Why VOOM cleans up anything, clean as can be. The he yelled, Take your hat off now. Take the VOOM off our head. Make it clean up the snow, Hurry you  one, two, three go. Then the Voom  it went VOOM And, oh boy What a VOOM Now dont ask me what Voom is. I never will know. But, boy Let me tell you it DOES clean up snow Ha ha, So you see laughed the cat. Now your snow is all white Now your work is all done Now your house is all right And you know where my little cats are? said the cat. That Voom blew my little cats back in my hat. And so, if you ever have spots, now and then, I will be very happy to come here again  With Little Cats'

const mida = 'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left to hide that horrible scar. Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleys (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldnt fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasnt punished. On the other hand, hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all hed tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figgs cabbage-smelling living room. 19 While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. ... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums, he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. I had a dream about a motorcycle, said Harry, remembering suddenly. It was flying. Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY Dudley and Piers sniggered. I know they dont, said Harry. It was only a dream. But he wished he hadnt said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasnt bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasnt blond. Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. 20 After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didnt look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. Make it move, he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didnt budge. Do it again, Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. This is boring, Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They werent. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: I get that all the time. I know, Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him. It must be really annoying. 21 The snake nodded vigorously. Where do you come from, anyway? Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa constrictor, Brazil. Was it nice there? The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. Oh, I see -- so youve never been to Brazil? As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. DUDLEY MR. DURSLEY COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT ITS DOING Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. Out of the way, you, he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo. The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. But the glass, he kept saying, where did the glass go? 22 The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernons car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, Harry was talking to it, werent you, Harry? Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals, before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. Hed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from. He couldnt remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a 23 closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang. CHAPTER THREE THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudleys gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudleys favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldnt be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernons old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. They stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall, he told Harry. Want to come upstairs and practice? No, thanks, said Harry. The poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick. Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what hed said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figgs. Mrs. Figg wasn t as bad as usual. It turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, 24 and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didnt trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. Whats this? he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. Your new school uniform, she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. Oh, he said, I didnt realize it had to be so wet. DotA be stupid, snapped Aunt Petunia. Im dyeing some of Dudleys old things gray for you. Itll look just like everyone elses when Ive finished. Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harrys new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, 25 on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. Get the mail, Dudley, said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. Make Harry get it. Get the mail, Harry. Make Dudley get it. Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley. Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernons sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didnt belong to the library, so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. 26 Hurry up, boy shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. What are you doing, checking for letter bombs? He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. Marges ill, he informed Aunt Petunia. Ate a funny whelk. --. Dad said Dudley suddenly. Dad, Harrys got something Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. Thats mine said Harry, trying to snatch it back. Whod be writing to you? sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didnt stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. P-P-Petunia he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. Vernon Oh my goodness -- Vernon They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasnt used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. I want to read that letter, he said loudly. want to read it, said Harry furiously, as its mine. Get out, both of you, croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. 27 Harry didnt move. I WANT MY LETTER he shouted. Let me see it demanded Dudley. OUT roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. Vernon, Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You dont think theyre watching the house? Watching -- spying -- might be following us, muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we dont want -- Harry could see Uncle Vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. No, he said finally. No, well ignore it. If they dont get an answer... Yes, thats best... we wont do anything.... But -- Im not having one in the house, Petunia Didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense? That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something hed never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. Wheres my letter? said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. Whos writing to me? No one. it was addressed to you by mistake, said Uncle Vernon shortly. I have burned it. 28 It was not a mistake, said Harry angrily, it had my cupboard on it. SILENCE yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... youre really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudleys second bedroom. Why? said Harry. Dont ask questions snapped his uncle. Take this stuff upstairs, now. The Dursleys house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernons sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog; in the corner was Dudleys first-ever television set, which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I dont want him in there... I need that room... make him get out.... Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday hed have given anything to be up here. Today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. Hed screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didnt have his room back. Harry was 29 thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, Theres another one Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive -- With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harrys letter clutched in his hand. Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom, he wheezed at Harry. Dudley -- go -- just go. Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter. Surely that meant theyd try again? And this time hed make sure they didnt fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustnt wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door'

const midb = 'Harry leapt into the air; hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncles face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernons lap. 30 Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. I want -- he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. See, he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, if they cant deliver them theyll just give up. Im not sure thatll work, Vernon. Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, theyre not like you and me, said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed Tiptoe Through the Tulips as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly? Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. No post on Sundays, he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, no damn letters today -- Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty 31 letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. Out OUT Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. That does it, said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. Were going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didnt dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. Shakeem off... shake em off, he would mutter whenever he did this. They didnt stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. Hed never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see, and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an undred 32 of these at the front desk. She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. Ill take them, said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. Wouldnt it be better just to go home, dear? Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didnt seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. Daddys gone mad, hasnt he? Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled. Its Monday, he told his mother. The Great Humbertos on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.  Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harrys eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernons old socks. Still, you werent eleven every day. 33 Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didnt answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what hed bought. Found the perfect place he said. Come on Everyone out It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. Storm forecast for tonight said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. And this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. Ive already got us some rations, said Uncle Vernon, so all aboard It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. Could do with some of those letters now, eh? he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didnt cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second 34 room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldnt sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudleys watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and hed be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten... nine -- maybe hed wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... one... BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. CHAPTER FOUR THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. Wheres the cannon? he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. 35 Whos there? he shouted. I warn you -- Im armed There was a pause. Then -- SMASH The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. Couldnt make us a cup o tea, could yeh? Its not been an easy journey... He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. Budge up, yeh great lump, said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. An heres Harry said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. Las time I saw you, you was only a baby, said the giant. Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yehve got yet moms eyes. Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. I demand that you leave at once, sit he said. You are breaking and entering 36 Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune, said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernons hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. Anyway -- Harry, said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but itll taste all right. From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, Who are you? The giant chuckled. True, I havent introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.'

const midc = 'He held out an enormous hand and shook Harrys whole arm. What about that tea then, eh? he said, rubbing his hands together. Id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it, mind. His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt 37 sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, Dont touch anything he gives you, Dudley. The giant chuckled darkly. Yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore, Dursley, don worry. He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, Im sorry, but I still dont really know who you are. The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Call me Hagrid, he said, everyone does. An like I told yeh, Im Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yehll know all about Hogwarts, o course. Er -- no, said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. Sorry, Harry said quickly. Sony? barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. It s them as should be sorry I knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou Hogwarts, fer cryin out loud Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all? All what? asked Harry. ALL WHAT? Hagrid thundered. Now wait jus one second He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. Do you mean ter tell me, he growled at the Dursleys, that this boy -- this boy -- knows nothin abou -- about ANYTHING? Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks werent bad. 38 I know some things, he said. I can, you know, do math and stuff. But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents world. What world? Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. DURSLEY he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like Mimblewimble. Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. But yeh must know about yet mom and dad, he said. I mean, theyre famous. Youre famous. What? My -- my mom and dad werent famous, were they? Yeh don know... yeh don know... Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. Yeh don know what yeh are? he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. Stop he commanded. Stop right there, sit I forbid you to tell the boy anything A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley An youve kept it from him all these years? Kept what from me? said Harry eagerly. STOP I FORBID YOU yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 39 Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh, said Hagrid. Harry -- yet a wizard. There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. -- a what? gasped Harry. A wizard, o course, said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, an a thumpin goodun, Id say, once yehve been trained up a bit. With a mum an dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An I reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter. Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, What does it mean, they await my owl? Gallopin Gorgons, that reminds me, said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet 40 another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weathers horrible. Hope youre Well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. Where was I? said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. Hes not going, he said. Hagrid grunted. Id like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him, he said. A what? said Harry, interested. A Muggle, said Hagrid, its what we call nonmagic folk like thern. An its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on. We swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish, said Uncle Vernon, swore wed stamp it out of him Wizard indeed You knew? said Harry. You knew Im a -- a wizard? Knew shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. Knew Of course we knew How 41 could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew youd be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash CAR CRASH roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. How could a car crash kill Lily an James Potter? Its an outrage A scandal Harry Potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name But why? What happened? Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrids face. He looked suddenly anxious. I never expected this, he said, in a low, worried voice. I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh, how much yeh didnt know. Ah, Harry, I don know if Im the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh cant go off ter Hogwarts not knowin. He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. Well, its best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I cant tell yeh everythin, its a great mystry, parts of it.... He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but its incredible yeh dont know his name, everyone in our world knows -- Who?  42 Well -- I don like sayin the name if I can help it. No one does. Why not? Gulpin gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was... Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. Could you write it down? Harry suggested. Nah -cant spell it. All right -- Voldemort.  Hagrid shuddered. Don make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin fer followers. Got em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o his power, cause he was gettin himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didnt know who ter trust, didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin over. Course, some stood up to him -- an he killed em. Horribly. One o the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledores the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didnt dare try takin the school, not jus then, anyway. Now, yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an girl at Hogwarts in their day Suppose the mystry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the Dark Side. Maybe he thought he could persuade em... maybe he just wanted em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an -- an -- Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. Sorry, he said. But its that sad -- knew yer mum an dad, an nicer people yeh couldnt find -- anyway... You-Know-Who killed em. An then -- an this is the real mystry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin by then. But he couldnt 43 do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. Thats what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an dad an yer house, even -- but it didnt work on you, an thats why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill em, no one except you, an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an you was only a baby, an you lived. Something very painful was going on in Harrys mind. As Hagrids story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledores orders. Brought yeh ter this lot... Load of old tosh, said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. Now, you listen here, boy, he snarled, I accept theres something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the worlds better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew theyd come to a sticky end -- But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, Im warning you, Dursley -Im warning you -- one more word...  In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernons courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. Thats better, said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. 44 Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who? Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. Thats the biggest mystry, see... he was gettin more an more powerful -- whyd he go?'

const midd = 'Regular Doctor Jim, who agreed that I was veritably  swimming in a paralyzing and totally clinical depression,  and that therefore my meds should be adjusted and also I  should attend a weekly Support Group. This Support Group featured a rotating cast of charac-  ters in various states of tumor-driven unwellness. Why did  the cast rotate? A side effect of dying. The Support Group, of course, was depressing as hell.  It met every Wednesday in the basement of a stone-walled  Episcopal church shaped like a cross. We all sat in a circle  right in the middle of the cross, where the two boards would  have met, where the heart of Jesus would have been. I noticed this because Patrick, the Support Group  Leader and only person over eighteen in the room, talked  about the heart of Jesus every freaking meeting, all about  how we, as young cancer survivors, were sitting right in  Christs very sacred heart and whatever. So heres how it went in Gods heart: The six or seven or  ten of us walked/wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection  of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust,  and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his  depressingly miserable life story— how he had cancer in his  balls and they thought he was going to die but he didnt die  and now here he is, a full-grown adult in a church basement  in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to  video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living   4  by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way  toward a masters degree that will not improve his career  prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles  to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years  ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only  the most generous soul would call his life. AND YOU TOO MIGHT BE SO LUCKY Then we introduced ourselves: Name. Age. Diagnosis.  And how were doing today. Im Hazel, Id say when theyd  get to me. Sixteen. Thyroid originally but with an impres-  sive and long-settled satellite colony in my lungs. And Im  doing okay. Once we got around the circle, Patrick always asked if  anyone wanted to share. And then began the circle jerk of  support: everyone talking about fighting and battling and  winning and shrinking and scanning. To be fair to Patrick,  he let us talk about dying, too. But most of them werent  dying. Most would live into adulthood, as Patrick had. (Which meant there was quite a lot of competitiveness  about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer  itself, but also the other people in the room. Like, I realize  that this is irrational, but when they tell you that you have,  say, a 20 percent chance of living five years, the math kicks  in and you figure thats one in five ... so you look around  and think, as any healthy person would: I gotta outlast four  of these bastards.)   5   John Green   The only redeeming facet of Support Group was this  kid named Isaac, a long-faced, skinny guy with straight  blond hair swept over one eye. And his eyes were the problem. He had some  fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut  out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick  glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass  one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically  just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what  I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with  the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in  mortal peril. Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through  sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or  snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, hed glance  over at me and sigh ever so slightly. Id shake my head  microscopically and exhale in response. So Support Group blew, and after a few weeks, I grew to  be rather kicking-and-screaming about the whole affair.  In fact, on the Wednesday I made the acquaintance of  Augustus Waters, I tried my level best to get out of Support  Group while sitting on the couch with my mom in the third  leg of a twelve-hour marathon of the previous seasons  Americas Next Top Model, which admittedly I had already  seen, but still.   6  Me: I refuse to attend Support Group. Mom: One of the symptoms of depression is disinter-  est in activities. Me: Please just let me watch Americas Next Top Model.  Its an activity. Mom: Television is a passivity. Me: Ugh, Mom, please. Mom: Hazel, youre a teenager. Youre not a little kid  anymore. You need to make friends, get out of the house,  and live your life. Me: If you want me to be a teenager, dont send me to  Support Group. Buy me a fake ID so I can go to clubs, drink  vodka, and take pot. Mom: You dont take pot, for starters. Me: See, thats the kind of thing Id know if you got  me a fake ID. Mom: Youre going to Support Group. Me: UGGGGGGGGGGGGG. Mom: Hazel, you deserve a life. That shut me up, although I failed to see how  attendance at Support Group met the definition of life.  Still, I agreed to go— after negotiating the right to record  the 1.5 episodes of ANTM Id be missing. I went to Support Group for the same reason that  Id once allowed nurses with a mere eighteen months of  graduate education to poison me with exotically named   7   John Green   chemicals: I wanted to make my parents happy. There is  only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from  cancer when youre sixteen, and thats having a kid who  bites it from cancer. Mom pulled into the circular driveway behind the church  at 4:56. I pretended to fiddle with my oxygen tank for a  second just to kill time. Do you want me to carry it in for you? No, its fine, I said. The cylindrical green tank only  weighed a few pounds, and I had this little steel cart to  wheel it around behind me. It delivered two liters of oxygen  to me each minute through a cannula, a transparent tube  that split just beneath my neck, wrapped behind my ears,  and then reunited in my nostrils. The contraption was  necessary because my lungs sucked at being lungs. I love you, she said as I got out. You too, Mom. See you at six. Make friends she said through the rolled-down  window as I walked away. I didnt want to take the elevator because taking the  elevator is a Last Days kind of activity at Support Group,  so I took the stairs. I grabbed a cookie and poured some  lemonade into a Dixie cup and then turned around. A boy was staring at me. I was quite sure Id never seen him before. Long and   8  leanly muscular, he dwarfed the molded plastic elementary  school chair he was sitting in. Mahogany hair, straight and  short. He looked my age, maybe a year older, and he sat  with his tailbone against the edge of the chair, his posture  aggressively poor, one hand half in a pocket of dark jeans. I looked away, suddenly conscious of my myriad  insufficiencies. I was wearing old jeans, which had once  been tight but now sagged in weird places, and a yellow  T-shirt advertising a band I didnt even like anymore. Also  my hair: I had this pageboy haircut, and I hadnt even  bothered to, like, brush it. Furthermore, I had ridiculously  fat chipmunked cheeks, a side effect of treatment. I looked  like a normally proportioned person with a balloon for a  head. This was not even to mention the cankle situation.  And yet— I cut a glance to him, and his eyes were still on me. It occurred to me why they call it eye contact. I walked into the circle and sat down next to Isaac,  two seats away from the boy. I glanced again. He was still  watching me. Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy  stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at  worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy . . . well. I pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would dis-  play the time: 4:59. The circle filled in with the unlucky  twelve-to-eighteens, and then Patrick started us out with  the serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things   9   John Green   I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wis-  dom to know the difference. The guy was still staring at me. I  felt rather blushy. Finally, I decided that the proper strategy was to stare  back. Boys do not have a monopoly on the Staring Business,  after all. So I looked him over as Patrick acknowledged for  the thousandth time his ball-lessness etc., and soon it was  a staring contest. After a while the boy smiled, and then  finally his blue eyes glanced away. When he looked back at  me, I flicked my eyebrows up to say, I win. He shrugged. Patrick continued and then finally it was  time for the introductions. Isaac, perhaps youd like to go  first today. I know youre facing a challenging time. Yeah, Isaac said. Im Isaac. Im seventeen. And its  looking like I have to get surgery in a couple weeks, after  which Ill be blind. Not to complain or anything because I  know a lot of us have it worse, but yeah, I mean, being blind  does sort of suck. My girlfriend helps, though. And friends  like Augustus. He nodded toward the boy, who now had  a name. So, yeah, Isaac continued. He was looking at his  hands, which hed folded into each other like the top of a  tepee. Theres nothing you can do about it. Were here for you, Isaac, Patrick said. Let Isaac hear  it, guys. And then we all, in a monotone, said, Were here  for you, Isaac. Michael was next. He was twelve. He had leukemia.   10  Hed always had leukemia. He was okay. (Or so he said. Hed  taken the elevator.) Lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object  of the hot boys eye. She was a regular— in a long remission  from appendiceal cancer, which I had not previously known  existed. She said— as she had every other time Id attended  Support Group— that she felt strong, which felt like bragging  to me as the oxygen-drizzling nubs tickled my nostrils. There were five others before they got to him. He smiled  a little when his turn came. His voice was low, smoky, and  dead sexy. My name is Augustus Waters, he said. Im  seventeen. I had a little touch of osteosarcoma a year and a  half ago, but Im just here today at Isaacs request. And how are you feeling? asked Patrick. Oh, Im grand. Augustus Waters smiled with a corner  of his mouth. Im on a roller coaster that only goes up, my  friend. When it was my turn, I said, My name is Hazel. Im  sixteen. Thyroid with mets in my lungs. Im okay. The hour proceeded apace: Fights were recounted,  battles won amid wars sure to be lost; hope was clung to;  families were both celebrated and denounced; it was agreed  that friends just didnt get it; tears were shed; comfort  proffered. Neither Augustus Waters nor I spoke again until  Patrick said, Augustus, perhaps youd like to share your  fears with the group.   11   John Green   My fears?  Yes. I fear oblivion, he said without a moments pause.  I fear it like the proverbial blind man whos afraid of the  dark. Too soon, Isaac said, cracking a smile. Was that insensitive? Augustus asked. I can be  pretty blind to other peoples feelings. Isaac was laughing, but Patrick raised a chastening  finger and said, Augustus, please. Lets return to you and  your struggles. You said you fear oblivion? I did, Augustus answered. Patrick seemed lost. Would, uh, would anyone like to  speak to that? I hadnt been in proper school in three years. My  parents were my two best friends. My third best friend was  an author who did not know I existed. I was a fairly shy  person— not the hand-raising type. And yet, just this once, I decided to speak. I half raised  my hand and Patrick, his delight evident, immediately said,  Hazel I was, Im sure he assumed, opening up. Becoming  Part Of The Group. I looked over at Augustus Waters, who looked back  at me. You could almost see through his eyes they were  so blue. There will come a time, I said, when all of us  are dead. All of us. There will come a time when there are   12  no human beings remaining to remember that anyone  ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There  will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let  alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and  thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this— I  gestured encompassingly— will have been for naught.  Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of  years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we  will not survive forever. There was time before organisms  experienced consciousness, and there will be time after.  And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I  encourage you to ignore it. God knows thats what everyone  else does. Id learned this from my aforementioned third best  friend, Peter Van Houten, the reclusive author of An Imperial  Affliction, the book that was as close a thing as I had to a  Bible. Peter Van Houten was the only person Id ever come  across who seemed to (a) understand what its like to be  dying, and (b) not have died. After I finished, there was quite a long period of silence  as I watched a smile spread all the way across Augustuss  face— not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be  sexy while he stared at me, but his real smile, too big for  his face. Goddamn, Augustus said quietly. Arent you  something else. Neither of us said anything for the rest of Support   13   John Green   Group. At the end, we all had to hold hands, and Patrick led  us in a prayer. Lord Jesus Christ, we are gathered here in  Your heart, literally in Your heart, as cancer survivors. You and  You alone know us as we know ourselves. Guide us to life  and the Light through our times of trial. We pray for Isaacs  eyes, for Michaels and Jamies blood, for Augustuss bones,  for Hazels lungs, for Jamess throat. We pray that You  might heal us and that we might feel Your love, and Your  peace, which passes all understanding. And we remember in  our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone  home to you: Maria and Kade and Joseph and Haley and  Abigail and Angelina and Taylor and Gabriel and . . . It was a long list. The world contains a lot of dead  people. And while Patrick droned on, reading the list from  a sheet of paper because it was too long to memorize, I  kept my eyes closed, trying to think prayerfully but mostly  imagining the day when my name would find its way onto  that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped  listening.'

const mide = 'When Patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra  together-LIVING OUR BEST LIFE TODAY-and it was  over. Augustus Waters pushed himself out of his chair and  walked over to me. His gait was crooked like his smile. He  towered over me, but he kept his distance so I wouldnt  have to crane my neck to look him in the eye. Whats your  name? he asked. Hazel.   14  No, your full name. Um, Hazel Grace Lancaster. He was just about to say  something else when Isaac walked up. Hold on, Augustus  said, raising a finger, and turned to Isaac. That was actually  worse than you made it out to be. I told you it was bleak. Why do you bother with it? I dont know. It kind of helps? Augustus leaned in so he thought I couldnt hear.  Shes a regular? I couldnt hear Isaacs comment, but  Augustus responded, Ill say. He clasped Isaac by both  shoulders and then took a half step away from him. Tell  Hazel about clinic. Isaac leaned a hand against the snack table and  focused his huge eye on me. Okay, so I went into clinic  this morning, and I was telling my surgeon that Id rather  be deaf than blind. And he said, It doesnt work that way,  and I was, like, Yeah, I realize it doesnt work that way; Im  just saying Id rather be deaf than blind if I had the choice,  which I realize I dont have, and he said, Well, the good  news is that you wont be deaf, and I was like, Thank  you for explaining that my eye cancer isnt going to make  me deaf. I feel so fortunate that an intellectual giant like  yourself would deign to operate on me. He sounds like a winner, I said. Im gonna try to get  me some eye cancer just so I can make this guys acquain-  tance.   15   John Green   Good luck with that. All right, I should go. Monicas  waiting for me. I gotta look at her a lot while I can. Counterinsurgence tomorrow? Augustus asked. Definitely. Isaac turned and ran up the stairs, taking  them two at a time. Augustus Waters turned to me. Literally, he said. Literally? I asked. We are literally in the heart of Jesus, he said. I  thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally  in the heart of Jesus. Someone should tell Jesus, I said. I mean, its gotta  be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart. I would tell Him myself, Augustus said, but  unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He  wont be able to hear me. I laughed. He shook his head,  just looking at me. What? I asked. Nothing, he said. Why are you looking at me like that? Augustus half smiled. Because youre beautiful. I  enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago  not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. A  brief awkward silence ensued. Augustus plowed through: I  mean, particularly given that, as you so deliciously pointed  out, all of this will end in oblivion and everything. I kind of scoffed or sighed or exhaled in a way that was  vaguely coughy and then said, Im not beau—   16  Youre like a millennial Natalie Portman. Like V for  Vendetta Natalie Portman.  Never seen it, I said. Really? he asked. Pixie-haired gorgeous girl dislikes  authority and cant help but fall for a boy she knows is  trouble. Its your autobiography, so far as I can tell. His every syllable flirted. Honestly, he kind of turned  me on. I didnt even know that guys could turn me on— not,  like, in real life. A younger girl walked past us. Hows it going, Alisa?  he asked. She smiled and mumbled, Hi, Augustus.  Memorial people, he explained. Memorial was the big  research hospital. Where do you go? Childrens, I said, my voice smaller than I expected  it to be. He nodded. The conversation seemed over. Well,  I said, nodding vaguely toward the steps that led us out of  the Literal Heart of Jesus. I tilted my cart onto its wheels  and started walking. He limped beside me. So, see you next  time, maybe? I asked. You should see it, he said. V for Vendetta, I mean. Okay, I said. Ill look it up. No. With me. At my house, he said. Now. I stopped walking. I hardly know you, Augustus  Waters. You could be an ax murderer. He nodded. True enough, Hazel Grace. He walked  past me, his shoulders filling out his green knit polo shirt,  his back straight, his steps lilting just slightly to the right as   17   John Green   he walked steady and confident on what I had determined  was a prosthetic leg. Osteosarcoma sometimes takes a limb  to check you out. Then, if it likes you, it takes the rest. I followed him upstairs, losing ground as I made my  way up slowly, stairs not being a field of expertise for my  lungs. And then we were out of Jesuss heart and in the  parking lot, the spring air just on the cold side of perfect,  the late-afternoon light heavenly in its hurtfulness. Mom wasnt there yet, which was unusual, because  Mom was almost always waiting for me. I glanced around  and saw that a tall, curvy brunette girl had Isaac pinned  against the stone wall of the church, kissing him rather  aggressively. They were close enough to me that I could hear  the weird noises of their mouths together, and I could hear  him saying, Always, and her saying, Always, in return. Suddenly standing next to me, Augustus half  whispered, Theyre big believers in PDA. Whats with the always? The slurping sounds  intensified. Always is their thing. Theyll always love each other  and whatever. I would conservatively estimate they have  texted each other the word always four million times in the  last year. A couple more cars drove up, taking Michael and Alisa  away. It was just Augustus and me now, watching Isaac and  Monica, who proceeded apace as if they were not leaning   18  against a place of worship. His hand reached for her boob  over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers  moved around. I wondered if that felt good. Didnt seem  like it would, but I decided to forgive Isaac on the grounds  that he was going blind. The senses must feast while there  is yet hunger and whatever. Imagine taking that last drive to the hospital, I said  quietly. The last time youll ever drive a car. Without looking over at me, Augustus said, Youre  killing my vibe here, Hazel Grace. Im trying to observe  young love in its many-splendored awkwardness. I think hes hurting her boob, I said. Yes, its difficult to ascertain whether he is trying  to arouse her or perform a breast exam. Then Augustus  Waters reached into a pocket and pulled out, of all things,  a pack of cigarettes. He flipped it open and put a cigarette  between his lips. Are you serious? I asked. You think thats cool? Oh,  my God, you just ruined the whole thing. Which whole thing? he asked, turning to me. The  cigarette dangled unlit from the unsmiling corner of his  mouth. The whole thing where a boy who is not unattractive  or unintelligent or seemingly in any way unacceptable  stares at me and points out incorrect uses of literality and  compares me to actresses and asks me to watch a movie at  his house. But of course there is always a hamartia and yours   19   John Green   is that oh, my God, even though you HAD FREAKING  CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the  chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER. Oh, my God. Let  me just assure you that not being able to breathe? SUCKS.  Totally disappointing. Totally. A hamartia? he asked, the cigarette still in his mouth.  It tightened his jaw. He had a hell of a jawline, unfortunately. A fatal flaw, I explained, turning away from him. I  stepped toward the curb, leaving Augustus Waters behind  me, and then I heard a car start down the street. It was  Mom. Shed been waiting for me to, like, make friends or  whatever. I felt this weird mix of disappointment and anger  welling up inside of me. I dont even know what the feeling  was, really, just that there was a lot of it, and I wanted to  smack Augustus Waters and also replace my lungs with  lungs that didnt suck at being lungs. I was standing with  my Chuck Taylors on the very edge of the curb, the oxygen  tank ball-and-chaining in the cart by my side, and right as  my mom pulled up, I felt a hand grab mine. I yanked my hand free but turned back to him. They dont kill you unless you light them, he said  as Mom arrived at the curb. And Ive never lit one. Its a  metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your  teeth, but you dont give it the power to do its killing. Its a metaphor, I said, dubious. Mom was just idling.   20  Its a metaphor, he said. You choose your behaviors based on their metaphorical resonances ... I said. Oh, yes. He smiled. The big, goofy, real smile. Im a  big believer in metaphor, Hazel Grace. I turned to the car. Tapped the window. It rolled down.  Im going to a movie with Augustus Waters, I said. Please  record the next several episodes of the ANTM marathon for  me. Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that  we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had  was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was  exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the  persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more  liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way  across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up  the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesleys strictures on the use of many words  in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit  he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory  of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten  his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and  with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some  forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find  a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to  an impressive age and died rich.'

const midf =  'It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simons homestead,  Finchs Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient:  modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless  produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles  of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile. Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North  and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet  the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth  century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his  younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the  Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most  of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full. When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his  practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, was the county   seat of Maycomb County. Atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more  than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His  first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.  Atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead  Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were  Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The  Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding  arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to  do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-  coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in  pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus  could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was  probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of  criminal law. During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than  anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers  education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to  study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting  Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked  Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they  knew him, and because of Simon Finchs industry, Atticus was related by blood  or marriage to nearly every family in the town.  Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In  rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the  courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog  suffered on a summers day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in  the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Mens stiff collars wilted by  nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-oclock naps,  and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of  the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four   hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go,  nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries  of May comb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people:  Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself. We lived on the main residential street in town — Atticus, Jem and I, plus  Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us,  read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment. Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was  nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She  was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldnt behave as  well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasnt  ready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won,  mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem  was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember. Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham  from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state  legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was  the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two  years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her  family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and  sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play  by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to  bother him. When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries  (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house  two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We  were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an  unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for  days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell. That was the summer Dill came to us. Early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard, Jem and  I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverfords collard patch. We went   to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy — Miss Rachels rat terrier was  expecting — instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he  wasnt much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke: Hey. Hey yourself, said Jem pleasantly. Im Charles Baker Harris, he said. I can read. So what? I said. I just thought youd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin I  can do it... How old are you, asked Jem, four-and-a-half? Goin on seven. Shoot no wonder, then, said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. Scout yonders  been readin ever since she was born, and she aint even started to school yet. You  look right puny for goin on seven. Im little but Im old, he said. Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. Why dont you come over, Charles Baker Harris? he said. Lord, what a name. s not any funniern yours. Aunt Rachel says your names Jeremy Atticus Finch. Jem scowled. Im big enough to fit mine, he said. Your names longern you  are. Bet its a foot longer. Folks call me Dill, said Dill, struggling under the fence. Do better if you go over it instead of under it, I said. Whered you come from? Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a  photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and  won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show  twenty times on it. Dont have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse  sometimes, said Jem. Ever see anything good?   Dill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning  of respect. Tell it to us, he said. Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair  was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but  I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and  darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the  center of his forehead. When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than  the book, I asked Dill where his father was: You aint said anything about him. I havent got one. Is he dead? No... Then if hes not dead youve got one, havent you? Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and  found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine  contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin  chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas  based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs.  In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly  thrust upon me — the ape in Tarzan, Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys, Mr. Damon  in Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed  with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies. But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions,  and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it  drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on  the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm  around the fat pole, staring and wondering. The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one  faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low,  was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago   darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles  drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains  of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard — a swept yard that was never  swept — where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance. Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and  I had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down,  and peeped in windows. When peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was  because he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in  Maycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid  nocturnal events: peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated;  although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in  Barker s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their  initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut  across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school  grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall  pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the  children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a  lost ball and no questions asked. The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The  Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection  unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb s principal  recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street  for a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a  missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and  came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the  neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr.  Radley made his living — Jem said he bought cotton, a polite term for doing  nothing — but Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long  as anybody could remember. The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another  thing alien to Maycomb s ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather  only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore  corsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps   and call, He-y, of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did.  The Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any;  Atticus said yes, but before I was born. According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his  teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an  enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and  they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but  enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they  hung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and  went to the picture show; they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling  hell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole  whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy  was in with the wrong crowd. One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square  in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycomb s ancient beadle, Mr. Conner,  and locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to  be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he  was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it, so the boys came  before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace,  assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and  hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge;  Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard  them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where  boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and  decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was.  If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no  further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radleys word was his bond, the judge was  glad to do so. The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary  education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through  engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on  weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radleys boy was not seen again for   fifteen years. But there came a day, barely within Jems memory, when Boo Radley was heard  from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked  much about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticus s only answer  was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a  right to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said'

const midg =  'So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a  neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss  Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The  Maycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr.  Radley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parents leg, pulled them out,  wiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities. Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but  when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the  Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then. Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum,  when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo  wasnt crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr.  Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not  a criminal. The sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so  Boo was locked in the courthouse basement. Boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jems memory.  Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he  didnt take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could  not live forever on the bounty of the county. Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of  sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the  time. Atticus said no, it wasnt that sort of thing, that there were other ways of  making people into ghosts. My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk  to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I   would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with  colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp  and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie  Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we  believed her, because Mr. Radleys posture was ramrod straight. He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say,  Good morning, sir, and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radleys elder son lived  in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we  ever saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home,  people said the house died. But there came a day when Atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise  in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a  sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying. He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the  Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back  street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the  Radleys every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last  the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch  when Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house. There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into, murmured Calpurnia,  and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for  Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people. The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out,  but it had another think coming: Boos elder brother returned from Pensacola and  took Mr. Radleys place. The only difference between him and his father was  their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley bought cotton, too. Mr. Nathan would  speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him  coming from town with a magazine in his hand. The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer  he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder. Wonder what he does in there, he would murmur. Looks like hed just stick  his head out the door.   Jem said, He goes out, all right, when its pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford  said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight  through the window at her. . . said his head was like a skull lookin at her. Aint  you ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this- Jem slid his  feet through the gravel. Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at  night? Ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin, and one night I heard  him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus got there. Wonder what he looks like? said Dill. Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall,  judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch,  thats why his hands were bloodstained — if you ate an animal raw, you could  never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face;  what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most  of the time. Lets try to make him come out, said Dill. Id like to see what he looks like. Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock  on the front door. Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against two  Tom Swifts that Jem wouldnt get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life,  Jem had never declined a dare. Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head,  for Dill wore him down easily: Youre scared, Dill said, the first day. Aint  scared, just respectful, Jem said. The next day Dill said, Youre too scared even  to put your big toe in the front yard. Jem said he reckoned he wasnt, hed passed  the Radley Place every school day of his life. Always runnin, I said. But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly  werent as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that hed never seen such scary folks  as the ones in Maycomb. This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned  against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.   I hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one, Dill  Harris, said Jem, when we joined him. Dont blame me when he gouges your  eyes out. You started it, remember. Youre still scared, murmured Dill patiently. Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything: Its  just that I cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us.  Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of. When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the  time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: If I got killed, whatd become  of you? he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility  left him until confronted by the Radley Place. You gonna run out on a dare? asked Dill. If you are, then- Dill, you have to think about these things, Jem said. Lemme think a minute. . .  its sort of like making a turtle come out. Hows that? asked Dill. Strike a match under him. I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him. Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful. Aint hateful, just persuades him — s not like youd chunk him in the fire, Jem  growled. How do you know a match dont hurt him? Turtles cant feel, stupid, said Jem. Were you ever a turtle, huh? My stars, Dill Now lemme think. . . reckon we can rock him. . . Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: I wont say you  ran out on a dare an Ill swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the  house. Jem brightened. Touch the house, that all? Dill nodded. Sure thats all, now? I dont want you hollerin something different the minute I   get back.  Yeah, thats all, said Dill. Hell probably come out after you when he sees you  in the yard, then Scoutn 4 mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell  him we aint gonna hurt him. We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house,  and stopped at the gate. Well go on, said Dill, Scout and mes right behind you. Im going, said Jem, dont hurry me. He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as  if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head. Then I sneered at him. Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his  palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and  I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked  back. The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we  thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement,  and the house was still.  Contents - Prev / Next  Chapter 2 Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five  oclock bus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would  be starting to school in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my  life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the  schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem  had given me, learning their games, following Jems red jacket through wriggling  circles of blind mans buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories.  I longed to join them. Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by ones  parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room  was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted  around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jems  pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was  careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to  approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to  embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at  recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the  fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone. You mean we cant play any more? I asked. Well do like we always do at home, he said, but youll see — schools  different. It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our  teacher, hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand  with a ruler, then made me stand in the corner until noon. Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink  cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and  a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop. She boarded across the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinsons  upstairs front room, and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a  haze for days. Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, This says I am Miss  Caroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County. The class  murmured apprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the  peculiarities indigenous to that region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union  on January 11, 1861, Winston County seceded from Alabama, and every child in  Maycomb County knew it.) North Alabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big  Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no  background.   Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had long  conversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a  warm house beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for  an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of  catawba worms. Miss Caroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted  and flour sack- skirted first grade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs  from the time they were able to walk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the story and said, Oh, my, wasnt that nice? Then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square  capitals, turned to the class and asked, Does anybody know what these are? Everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year. I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faint  line appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of My First  Reader and the stock-market quotations from The Mobile Register aloud, she  discovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. Miss  Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere  with my reading. Teach me? I said in surprise. He hasnt taught me anything, Miss Caroline.  Atticus aint got time to teach me anything, I added, when Miss Caroline smiled  and shook her head. Why, hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and  reads. If he didnt teach you, who did? Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly.  Somebody did. You werent born reading The Mobile Register . Jem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch.  Jem says my names really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was  born and Im really a- Miss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. Lets not let our imaginations run  away with us, dear, she said. Now you tell your father not to teach you any  more. Its best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him Ill take over from  here and try to undo the damage- Maam?   Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now.  I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never  deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the  daily papers. In the long hours of church — was it then I learned? I could not  remember not being able to read hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about  it, reading was something that just came to me, as learning to fasten the seat of  my union suit without looking around, or achieving two bows from a snarl of  shoelaces. I could not remember when the lines above Atticuss moving finger  separated into words, but I had stared at them all the evenings in my memory,  listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws, the diaries of  Lorenzo Dow — anything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawled into his  lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not  love breathing. I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and stared out the  window until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the  schoolyard. He asked how I was getting along. I told him. If I didnt have to stay Id leave. Jem, that damn lady says Atticuss been  teaching me to read and for him to stop it- Dont worry, Scout, Jem comforted me. Our teacher says Miss Carolines  introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. Itll be in all  the grades soon. You dont have to learn much out of books that way — its like if  you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see? Yeah Jem, but I dont wanta study cows, I- Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, theyre a big part of life in Maycomb  County. I contented myself with asking Jem if hed lost his mind. Im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade, stubborn.  Its the Dewey Decimal System.  Having never questioned Jems pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now.  The Dewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at  us on which were printed the, cat, rat, man, and you. No comment   seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic  revelations in silence. I was bored, so I began a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline  caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. Besides,  she said. We dont write in the first grade, we print. You wont learn to write  until youre in the third grade. Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, I  guess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the  top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced  her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of  bread and butter and sugar. In Calpurnia s teaching, there was no sentimentality: I  seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me. Everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands, said Miss Caroline,  breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia. The town children did so, and she looked us over. Everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk. Molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic  light. Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch  containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. She  stopped at Walter Cunninghams desk. Wheres yours? she asked. Walter Cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms.  His absence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught hookworms going  barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had owned any shoes he  would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-  winter. He did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls. Did you forget your lunch this morning? asked Miss Caroline. Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw. Did you forget it this morning? asked Miss Caroline. Walters jaw twitched  again. Yebm, he finally mumbled. Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. Heres a quarter, she said  to Walter. Go and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow.   Walter shook his head. Nome thank you maam, he drawled softly. Impatience crept into Miss Carolines voice: Here Walter, come get it. Walter shook his head again. When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, Go on and tell  her, Scout. I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation  looking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice already, and they were  looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding. I rose graciously on Walters behalf: Ah — Miss Caroline? What is it, Jean Louise? Miss Caroline, hes a Cunningham. I sat back down. What, Jean Louise? I thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear enough to the rest of  us: Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. He didnt forget his  lunch, he didnt have any. He had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or  the next day. He had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time  in his life. I tried again: Walters one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline. I beg your pardon, Jean Louise? Thats okay, maam, youll get to know all the county folks after a while. The  Cunninghams never took anything they cant pay back — no church baskets and no  scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what  they have. They dont have much, but they get along on it. My special knowledge of the Cunningham tribe — one branch, that is — was gained  from events of last winter. Walters father was one of Atticuss clients. After a  dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment, before Mr.  Cunningham left he said, Mr. Finch, I dont know when Ill ever be able to pay  you. Let that be the least of your worries, Walter, Atticus said.   When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a condition of  having your tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us. Not in money, Atticus said, but before the years out Ill have been paid. You  watch. We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard.  Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a  crate of smilax and holly. That spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip  greens, Atticus said Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him. Why does he pay you like that? I asked. Because thats the only way he can pay me. He has no money. Are we poor, Atticus? Atticus nodded. We are indeed. Jems nose wrinkled. Are we as poor as the Cunninghams? Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them  hardest. Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. As  Maycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for  doctors and dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunninghams vexations. The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and  the little cash he made went to interest. If he held his mouth right, Mr.  Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his land would go to ruin if he left it, and  he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased. Mr.  Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men. As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with  what they had. Did you know, said Atticus, that Dr. Reynolds works the same  way? He charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby. Miss  Scout, if you give me your attention Ill tell you what entailment is. Jems  definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes. If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would have saved  myself some inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent mortification, but it  was beyond my ability to explain things as well as Atticus, so I said, Youre   shamin him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you, and  you cant use any stovewood. Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back  to her desk. Jean Louise, Ive had about enough of you this morning, she said.  Youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your  hand. I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in  Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral  contracts. Wondering what bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an  answer, but the class looked back at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up  her ruler, gave me half a dozen quick little pats, then told me to stand in the  corner. A storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that  Miss Caroline had whipped me. When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded  again, becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them.  Miss Blount, a native Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the  Decimal System, appeared at the door hands on hips and announced: If I hear  another sound from this room Ill burn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the  sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket My sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss Caroline  watched the class file out for lunch. As I was the last to leave, I saw her sink  down into her chair and bury her head in her arms. Had her conduct been more  friendly toward me, I would have felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.  Contents - Prev / Next  Chapter 3 Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when  I was rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop. Youre'

const midh =  'biggern he is, he said. Hes as old as you, nearly, I said. He made me start off on the wrong foot.  Let him go, Scout. Why? He didnt have any lunch, I said, and explained my involvement in Walters  dietary affairs. Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to Jem and me.  His fists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught from both of us. I stomped  at him to chase him away, but Jem put out his hand and stopped me. He examined  Walter with an air of speculation. Your daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old  Sarum? he asked, and Walter nodded. Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as Dill  Harriss, were red-rimmed and watery. There was no color in his face except at  the tip of his nose, which was moistly pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls,  nervously picking at the metal hooks. Jem suddenly grinned at him. Come on home to dinner with us, Walter, he said.  Wed be glad to have you. Walters face brightened, then darkened. Jem said, Our daddys a friend of your daddys. Scout here, shes crazy — she  wont fight you any more. I wouldnt be too certain of that, I said. Jems free dispensation of my pledge  irked me, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. Yeah Walter, I  wont jump on you again. Dont you like butterbeans? Our Cals a real good  cook. Walter stood where he was, biting his lip. Jem and I gave up, and we were nearly  to the Radley Place when Walter called, Hey, Im comin When Walter caught up with us, Jem made pleasant conversation with him. A  haint lives there, he said cordially, pointing to the Radley house. Ever hear  about him, Walter? Reckon I have, said Walter. Almost died first year I come to school and et  them pecans — folks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the  fence.   Jem seemed to have little fear of Boo Radley now that Walter and I walked beside  him. Indeed, Jem grew boastful: I went all the way up to the house once, he said  to Walter. Anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he  passes it, I said to the clouds above. And whos runnin, Miss Priss? You are, when aint anybody with you. By the time we reached our front steps Walter had forgotten he was a  Cunningham. Jem ran to the kitchen and asked Calpurnia to set an extra plate, we  had company. Atticus greeted Walter and began a discussion about crops neither  Jem nor I could follow. Reason I cant pass the first grade, Mr. Finch, is Ive had to stay out ever 4 spring  an help Papa with the choppin 4 , but theres anothern at the house now thats  field size. Did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him? I asked, but Atticus shook his head at  me. While Walter piled food on his plate, he and Atticus talked together like two men,  to the wonderment of Jem and me. Atticus was expounding upon farm problems  when Walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. Atticus  summoned Calpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. She stood waiting  for Walter to help himself. Walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a  generous hand. He would probably have poured it into his milk glass had I not  asked what the sam hill he was doing. The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his  hands in his lap. Then he ducked his head. Atticus shook his head at me again. But hes gone and drowned his dinner in  syrup, I protested. Hes poured it all over- It was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen. She was furious, and when she was furious Calpurnia s grammar became erratic.  When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybodys in Maycomb. Atticus  said Calpurnia had more education than most colored folks.   When she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. Theres  some folks who dont eat like us, she whispered fiercely, but you aint called on  to contradict em at the table when they dont. That boys yo compny and if he  wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear? He aint company, Cal, hes just a Cunningham- Hush your mouth Dont matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this houses  yo compny, and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you  was so high and mighty Yo folks might be better n the Cunninghams but it  dont count for nothin the way youre disgracnT em — if you cant act fit to eat  at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen Calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging  smack. I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though,  that I was spared the humiliation of facing them again. I told Calpurnia to just  wait, Id fix her: one of these days when she wasnt looking Id go off and drown  myself in Barkers Eddy and then shed be sorry. Besides, I added, shed already  gotten me in trouble once today: she had taught me to write and it was all her  fault. Hush your fussin, she said. Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise Atticus  of Calpurnia s iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place. She  likes Jem bettern she likes me, anyway, I concluded, and suggested that Atticus  lose no time in packing her off. Have you ever considered that Jem doesnt worry her half as much? Atticus s  voice was flinty. Ive no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. We couldnt  operate a single day without Cal, have you ever thought of that? You think about  how much Cal does for you, and you mind her, you hear? I returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered  my resentments. I looked up to see Miss Caroline standing in the middle of the  room, sheer horror flooding her face. Apparently she had revived enough to  persevere in her profession. Its alive she screamed. The male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. Lord, I thought,   shes scared of a mouse. Little Chuck Little, whose patience with all living things  was phenomenal, said, Which way did he go, Miss Caroline? Tell us where he  went, quick D.C.- he turned to a boy behind him — D.C., shut the door and  well catch him. Quick, maam, whered he go? Miss Caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk, but to a  hulking individual unknown to me. Little Chucks face contracted and he said  gently, You mean him, maam? Yessum, hes alive. Did he scare you some  way? Miss Caroline said desperately, I was just walking by when it crawled out of his  hair. . . just crawled out of his hair- Little Chuck grinned broadly. There aint no need to fear a cootie, maam. Aint  you ever seen one? Now dont you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and  teach us some more. Little Chuck Little was another member of the population who didnt know where  his next meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman. He put his hand  under her elbow and led Miss Caroline to the front of the room. Now dont you  fret, maam, he said. There aint no need to fear a cootie. Ill just fetch you  some cool water. The cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor  he had wrought. He searched the scalp above his forehead, located his guest and  pinched it between his thumb and forefinger. Miss Caroline watched the process in horrid fascination. Little Chuck brought  water in a paper cup, and she drank it gratefully. Finally she found her voice.  What is your name, son? she asked softly. The boy blinked. Who, me? Miss Caroline nodded. Burris Ewell. Miss Caroline inspected her roll-book. I have a Ewell here, but I dont have a  first name. . . would you spell your first name for me? Dont know how. They call me Burrist home.'


const midi = 'At the age of thirteen, Theo was still undecided about his future. One day he dreamed of being a famous trial lawyer, one who handled the biggest cases and never lost before juries. The next day he dreamed of being a great judge, noted for his wisdom and fairness. He went back and forth, changing his mind daily. The main lobby was already busy on this Monday morning, as if the lawyers and their clients wanted an early start to the week. There was a crowd waiting by the elevator, so Theo raced up two flights of stairs and down the east wing where Family Court was held. His mother was a noted divorce lawyer, one who always represented the wife, and Theo knew this area of the building well. Since divorce trials were decided by judges, juries were not used, and since most judges preferred not to have large groups of spectators observing such sensitive matters, the courtroom was small. By its door, several lawyers huddled importantly, obviously not agreeing on much. Theo searched the hallway, then turned a corner and saw his friend. She was sitting on one of the old wooden benches, alone, small and frail and nervous. When she saw him she smiled and put a hand over her mouth. Theo hustled over and sat next to her, very closely, knees touching. With any other girl he would have placed himself at least two feet away and prevented any chance of contact. But April Finnemore was not just any girl. They had started prekindergarten together at the age of four at a nearby church school, and they had been close friends since they could remember. It wasnt a romance; they were too young for that. Theo did not know of a single thirteen-year-old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend. Just the opposite. They wanted nothing to do with them. And the girls felt the same way. Theo had been warned that things would change, and dramatically, but that seemed unlikely. April was just a friend, and one in a great deal of need at the moment. Her parents were divorcing, and Theo was extremely grateful his mother was not involved with the case. The divorce was no surprise to anyone who knew the Finnemores. Aprils father was an eccentric antiques dealer and the drummer for an old rock band that still played in nightclubs and toured for weeks at a time. Her mother raised goats and made goat cheese, which she peddled around town in a converted funeral hearse, painted bright yellow. An ancient spider monkey with gray whiskers rode shotgun and munched on the cheese, which had never sold very well. Mr. Boone had once described the family as nontraditional, which Theo took to mean downright weird. Both her parents had been arrested on drug charges, though neither had served time. Are you okay? Theo asked. No, she said. I hate being here. She had an older brother named August and an older sister named March, and both fled the family. August left the day after he graduated from high school. March dropped out at the age of sixteen and left town, leaving April as the only child for her parents to torment. Theo knew all of this because April told him everything. She had to. She needed someone outside of her family to confide in, and Theo was her listener. I dont want to live with either one of them, she said. It was a terrible thing to say about ones parents, but Theo understood completely. He despised her parents for the way they treated her. He despised them for the chaos of their lives, for their neglect of April, for their cruelty to her. Theo had a long list of grudges against Mr. and Mrs. Finnemore. He would run away before being forced to live there. He did not know of a single kid in town whod ever set foot inside the Finnemore home. The divorce trial was in its third day, and April would soon be called to the witness stand to testify. The judge would ask her the fateful question, April, which parent do you want to live with? And she did not know the answer. She had discussed it for hours with Theo, and she still did not know what to say. The great question in Theos mind was, Why did either parent want custody of April? Each had neglected her in so many ways. He had heard many stories, but he had never repeated a single one. What are you going to say? he asked. Im telling the judge that I want to live with my aunt Peg in Denver. I thought she said no. She did. Then you cant say that. What can I say, Theo? My mother would say that you should choose your mother. I know shes not your first choice, but you dont have a first choice. But the judge can do whatever he wants, right? Right. If you were fourteen, you could make a binding decision. At thirteen, the judge will only consider your wishes. According to my mother, this judge almost never awards custody to the father. Play it safe. Go with your mother. April wore jeans, hiking boots, and a navy sweater. She rarely dressed like a girl, but her gender was never in doubt. She wiped a tear from her cheek, but managed to keep her composure. Thanks, Theo, she said. I wish I could stay. And I wish I could go to school. They both managed a forced laugh. Ill be thinking about you. Be strong. Thanks, Theo. His favorite judge was the Honorable Henry Gantry, and he entered the great mans outer office at twenty minutes after 8:00 a.m. Well, good morning, Theo, Mrs. Hardy said. She was stirring something into her coffee and preparing to begin her work. Morning, Mrs. Hardy, Theo said with a smile. And to what do we owe this honor? she asked. She was not quite as old as Theos mother, he guessed, and she was very pretty. She was Theos favorite of all the secretaries in the courthouse. His favorite clerk was Jenny over in Family Court. I need to see Judge Gantry, he replied. Is he in? Well, yes, but hes very busy. Please. Itll just take a minute. She sipped her coffee, then asked, Does this have anything to do with the big trial tomorrow? Yes, maam, it does. Id like for my Government class to watch the first day of the trial, but I gotta make sure there will be enough seats. Oh, I dont know about that, Theo, Mrs. Hardy said, frowning and shaking her head. Were expecting an overflow crowd. Seating will be tight. Can I talk to the judge? How many are in your class? Sixteen. I thought maybe we could sit in the balcony. She was still frowning as she picked up the phone and pushed a button. She waited for a second, then said, Yes, Judge, Theodore Boone is here and would like to see you. I told him you are very busy. She listened some more, then put down the phone. Hurry, she said, pointing to the judges door. Seconds later, Theo stood before the biggest desk in town, a desk covered with all sorts of papers and files and thick binders, a desk that symbolized the enormous power held by Judge Henry Gantry, who, at that moment, was not smiling. In fact, Theo was certain the judge had not cracked a smile since hed interrupted his work. Theo, though, was pressing hard with a prolonged flash of metal from ear to ear. State your case, Judge Gantry said. Theo had heard him issue this command on many occasions. Hed seen lawyers, good lawyers, rise and stutter and search for words while Judge Gantry scowled down from the bench. He wasnt scowling now, nor was he wearing his black robe, but he was still intimidating. As Theo cleared his throat, he saw an unmistakable twinkle in his friends eye. Yes, sir, well, my Government teacher is Mr. Mount, and Mr. Mount thinks we might get approval from the principal for an all-day field trip to watch the opening of the trial tomorrow. Theo paused, took a deep breath, told himself again to speak clearly, slowly, forcefully, like all great trial lawyers. But, we need guaranteed seats. I was thinking we could sit in the balcony. Oh, you were? Yes, sir. How many? Sixteen, plus Mr. Mount. The judge picked up a file, opened it, and began reading as if hed suddenly forgotten about Theo standing at attention across the desk. Theo waited for an awkward fifteen seconds. Then the judge abruptly said, Seventeen seats, front balcony, left side. Ill tell the bailiff to seat you at ten minutes before nine, tomorrow. I expect perfect behavior. No problem, sir. Ill have Mrs. Hardy e-mail a note to your principal. Thanks, Judge. You can go now, Theo. Sorry to be so busy. No problem, sir. Theo was scurrying toward the door when the judge said, Say, Theo. Do you think Mr. Duffy is guilty? Theo stopped, turned around and without hesitating responded, Hes presumed innocent. Got that. But whats your opinion as to his guilt? I think he did it. The judge nodded slightly but gave no indication of whether he agreed. What about you? Theo asked. Finally, a smile. Im a fair and impartial referee, Theo. I have no preconceived notions of guilt or innocence. Thats what I thought youd say. See you tomorrow. Theo cracked the door and hustled out. Mrs. Hardy was on her feet, hands on hips, staring down two flustered lawyers who were demanding to see the judge. All three clammed up when Theo walked out of Judge Gantrys office. He smiled at Mrs. Hardy as he walked hurriedly by. Thanks, he said as he opened the door and disappeared. T Chapter 2 he ride from the courthouse to the middle school would take fifteen minutes if properly done, if one obeyed the traffic laws and refrained from trespassing. And normally this is the way Theo would do things, except when he was running a bit late. He flew down Market Street the wrong way, jumped the curb just ahead of a car, and bolted through a parking lot, used every sidewalk available, then—his most serious offense—he ducked between two houses on Elm Street. Theo heard someone yelling from the porch behind him until he was safely into an alley that ran into the teachers parking lot behind his school. He checked his watch—nine minutes. Not bad. He parked at the rack by the flagpole, secured his bike with a chain, then entered with a flood of kids whod just stepped off a bus. The eight forty bell was ringing when he walked into his homeroom and said good morning to Mr. Mount, who not only taught him Government but was his adviser as well. Talked to Judge Gantry, Theo said at the teachers desk, one considerably smaller than the one hed just left in the courthouse. The room was buzzing with the usual early morning chaos. All sixteen boys were present and all appeared to be involved in some sort of gag, scuffle, joke, or shoving match. And? Got the seats, first thing in the morning. Excellent. Great job, Theo. Mr. Mount eventually restored order, called the roll, made his announcements, and ten minutes later sent the boys down the hall to their first period Spanish class with Madame Monique. There was some awkward flirting between the rooms as the boys mixed with the girls. During classes, they were gender-separated, according to a new policy adopted by the smart people in charge of educating all the children in town. The genders were free to mingle at all other times. Madame Monique was a tall, dark lady from Cameroon, in West Africa. She had moved to Strattenburg three years earlier when her husband, also from Cameroon, took a job at the local college where he taught languages. She was not the typical teacher at the middle school, far from it. As a child in Africa, she had grown up speaking Beti, her tribal dialect, as well as French and English, the official languages of Cameroon. Her father was a doctor, and thus could afford to send her to school in Switzerland, where she picked up German and Italian. Her Spanish had been perfected when she went to college in Madrid. She was currently working on Russian with plans to move on to Mandarin Chinese. Her classroom was filled with large, colorful maps of the world, and her students believed shed been everywhere, seen everything, and could speak any language. Its a big world, she told them many times, and most people in other countries speak more than one language. While the students concentrated on Spanish, they were also encouraged to explore others. Theos mother had been studying Spanish for twenty years, and as a preschooler he had learned from her many of the basic words and phrases. Some of her clients were from Central America, and when Theo saw them at the office he was ready to practice. They always thought it was cute. Madame Monique had told him that he had an ear for languages, and this had inspired him to study harder. She was often asked by her curious students to say something in German. Or, Speak some Italian. She would, but first the student making the request had to stand and say a few words in that language. Bonus points were given, and this created enthusiasm. Most of the boys in Theos class knew a few dozen words in several languages. Aaron, who had a Spanish mother and a German father, was by far the most talented linguist. But Theo was determined to catch him. After Government, Spanish was his favorite class, and Madame Monique ran a close second to Mr. Mount as his favorite teacher. Today, though, he had trouble concentrating. They were studying Spanish verbs, a tedious chore on a good day, and Theos mind was elsewhere. He worried about April and her awful day on the witness stand. He couldnt imagine the horror of being forced to choose one parent over another. And when he managed to set April aside, he was consumed with the murder trial and couldnt'

const midj = 'wait until tomorrow, to watch the opening statements by the lawyers. Most of his classmates dreamed of getting tickets to the big game or concert. Theo Boone lived for the big trials. Second period was Geometry with Miss Garman. It was followed by a short break outdoors, then the class returned to homeroom, to Mr. Mount and the best hour of the day, at least in Theos opinion. Mr. Mount was in his midthirties, and had once worked as a lawyer at a gigantic firm in a skyscraper in Chicago. His brother was a lawyer. His father and grandfather had been lawyers and judges. Mr. Mount, though, had grown weary of the long hours and high pressure, and, well, hed quit. Hed walked away from the big money and found something he found far more rewarding. He loved teaching, and though he still thought of himself as a lawyer, he considered the classroom far more important than the courtroom. Because he knew the law so well, his Government class spent most of its time discussing cases, old ones and current ones and even fictitious ones on television. All right, men, he began when they were seated and still. He always addressed them as men and for thirteen-year-olds there was no greater compliment. Tomorrow I want you here at eight fifteen. Well take a bus to the courthouse and well be in our seats in plenty of time. Its a field trip, approved by the principal, so you will be excused from all other classes. Bring lunch money and well eat at Pappys Deli. Any questions? The men were hanging on every word, excitement all over their faces. What about backpacks? someone asked. No, Mr. Mount answered. You cant take anything into the courtroom. Security will be tight. It is, after all, the first murder trial here in a long time. Any more questions? What should we wear? Slowly, all eyes turned to Theo, including those of Mr. Mount. It was well known that Theo spent more time in the courthouse than most lawyers. Coat and tie, Theo? Mr. Mount asked. No, not at all. What were wearing now is fine. Great. Any more questions? Good. Now, Ive asked Theo if he would sort of set the stage for tomorrow. Lay out the courtroom, give us the players, tell us what were in for. Theo. Theos laptop was already wired to the overhead projector. He walked to the front of the class, pressed a key, and a large diagram appeared on the digital wide-screen whiteboard. This is the main courtroom, Theo said, in his best lawyers voice. He held a laser pointer with a red light and sort of waved it around the diagram. At the top, in the center here, is the bench. Thats where the judge sits They say the world is flat and supported on the back of four elephants who themselves stand on the back of a giant turtle. They say that the elephants, being such huge beasts, have bones of rock and iron, and nerves of gold for better conductivity over long distances.* They say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains. No one actually saw it land, which raised the interesting philosophical point: When millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky, but there is no one to hear it, does it— philosophically speaking—make a noise? And if there was no one to see it hit, did it actually hit? In other words, wasnt it just a story for children, to explain away some interesting natural occurrences? As for the dwarfs, whose legend it is, and who mine a lot deeper than other people, they say that there is a grain of truth in it. On a clear day, from the right vantage point on the Ramtops, a watcher could see a very long way across the plains. If it was high summer, they could count the columns of dust as the ox trains plodded on at a top speed of two miles an hour, each two pulling a train of two wagons carrying four tons each. Things took a long time to get anywhere, but when they did, there was certainly a lot of them. To the cities of the Circle Sea they carried raw material, and sometimes people who were off to seek their fortune and a fistful of diamonds. To the mountains they brought manufactured goods, rare things from across the oceans, and people who had found wisdom and a few scars. There was usually a days traveling between each convoy. They turned the landscape into an unrolled time machine. On a clear day, you could see last Tuesday. Heliographs twinkled in the distant air as the columns flashed messages back and forth about bandit presence, cargoes and the best place to get double egg, treble chips and a steak that overhung the plate all around. Lots of people traveled on the carts. It was cheap, it beat walking, and you got there eventually. Some people traveled for free. The driver of one wagon was having problems with his team. They were skittish. Hed expect this in the mountains, where all sorts of wild creatures might regard the oxen as a traveling meal. Here there was nothing more dangerous than cabbages, wasnt there? Behind him, down in a narrow space between the loads of cut lumber, something slept. It was just another day in Ankh-Morpork  Sergeant Colon balanced on a shaky ladder at one end of the Brass Bridge, one of the citys busiest thoroughfares. He clung by one hand to the tall pole with the box on top of it, and with the other he held a homemade picture book up to the slot in the front of the box. And this is another sort of cart, he said. Got it? S, said a very small voice from within the box. O-kay, said Colon, apparently satisfied. He dropped the book and pointed down the length of the bridge. Now, you see those two markers what has been painted across the cobbles? S. And they mean ? If-a-cart-gs-tween-dem-in-lessna-minute-s-goin-toofas, the little voice parroted. Well done. And then you ? Painta pic-cher. Taking care to show ? Drivrs-face-or-cart-lisens. And if its nighttime you ?'

const midk = 'Use-der-salmander-to-make-it-brite  Well done, Rodney. And one of us will come along every day and collect your pictures. Got everything you want? S. Whats that, Sergeant? Colon looked down at the very large, brown upturned face, and smiled. Afternoon, All, he said, climbing ponderously down the ladder. What youre looking at, Mister Jolson, is the modern Watch for the new millenienienum num. S a bit big, Fred, said All Jolson, looking at it critically. Ive seen lots of smaller ones. Watch as in City Watch, All. Ah, right. Anyone goes too fast around here and Lord Vetinarill be looking at his picture next morning. The iconographs do not lie, All. Right, Fred. Cos theyre too stupid. His Lordships got fed up with carts speeding over the bridge, see, and asked us to do something about it. Im Head of Traffic now, you know. Is that good, Fred? I should just think so said Sergeant Colon expansively. Its up to me to keep the, er, arteries of the city from clogging up, leadin to a complete breakdown of commerce and ruination for us all. Most vital job there is, you could say. And its just you doing it, is it? Well, mainly. Mainly. Corporal Nobbs and the other lads help, of course. All Jolson scratched his nose. It was on a similar subject that I wanted to talk to you, Fred, said Jolson. No problem, All. Something very odds turned up outside my restaurant, Fred. Sergeant Colon followed the huge man around the corner. Fred usually liked Alls company because, next to All, he was very skinny indeed. All Jolson was a man whod show up on an atlas and change the orbit of smaller planets. Paving stones cracked under his feet. He combined in one body— and there was plenty of room left over—Ankh-Morporks best chef and its keenest eater, a circumstance made in mashed potato heaven. Sergeant Colon couldnt remember what the mans real first name had been; hed picked up the nickname by general acclaim, since no one seeing him in the street for the first time could believe that it was all Jolson. There was a big cart on Broad Way. Other traffic was backed up trying to maneuver around it. Had my meat delivered at lunchtime, Fred, and when my carter came out  All Jolson pointed to the large triangular construction locked around one wheel of the cart. It had been made of oak and steel, and then someone had sloshed some yellow paint over it. Fred tapped it carefully. I can see where your problem is, right here, he said. So how long was your carter in there? Well. I gave him lunch  And very good lunches you do, All, Ive always said. What was the special today? Smitten steak with cream sauce and slumpie, and Black Death meringue to follow, said All Jolson. There was a moment of silence as they both pictured this meal. Fred Colon gave a little sigh. Butter on the slumpie? You wouldnt insult me by suggesting Id leave it off, would you? A man could linger a long time over a meal like that, said Fred. The trouble is, the Patrician, All, gets very short about carts parking on the street for more than ten minutes. He reckons thats a sort of crime. Taking ten minutes to eat one of my lunches isnt a crime, Fred, its a tragedy, said All. It says here City Watch—fifteen-dollar removal, Fred. Thats a couple of days profits, Fred. Thing is, said Fred Colon, itll be paperwork, see? I cant just wave that away. I only wish I could. Theres all them counterfoils on the spike in my office. If it was me running the Watch, of course but my hands are tied, see  The two men stood some way apart, hands in pockets, apparently paying little attention to one another. Sergeant Colon began to whistle under his breath. I know a thing or two, said All, carefully. People think waiters aint got ears. I know lots of stuff, All, said Colon, jingling his pocket change. Both men stared at the sky for a while. I may have some honey ice cream left over from yesterday— Sergeant Colon looked down at the cart. Here, Mister Jolson, he said, in a voice of absolute surprise, some complete bastards put some sort of clamp on your wheel Well, well soon see about that. Colon pulled a couple of round, white-painted paddles from his belt, sighted on the Watch House semaphore tower peeking over the top of the old lemonade factory, waited until the watching gargoyle signaled him, and with a certain amount of verve and flair ripped off an impression of a man with stiff arms playing two games of table tennis at once. The teamll be along any minute—ah, watch this  A little farther along the street two trolls were carefully clamping a hay wagon. After a minute or two one of them happened to glance at the Watch House tower, nudged his colleague, produced two bats of his own and with, rather less élan than Sergeant Colon, sent a signal. When it was answered the trolls looked around, spotted Colon, and lumbered toward him. Ta-da, said Colon, proudly. Amazing, this new technology, said All Jolson, admiringly. And they mustve been, what, forty or fifty yards away? Sright, All. In the old days Idve had to blow a whistle. And theyll arrive here knowin it was me who wanted em, too. Instead of having to look and see it was you, said Jolson. Well, yeah, said Colon, aware that what had transpired might not be the brightest ray of light in the new dawn of the communications revolution. Of course, itd have worked just as well if theyd been streets away. On the other side of the city, even. And if I told the gargoyle to, as we say, put it on the big tower over on the Tump theyd have got it in Sto Lat within minutes, see? And thats twenty miles. At least. Amazing, Fred. Time moves on, All, said Colon, as the trolls reached them. constable Chert, who told you to clamp my friends cart? he demanded. Well, Sarge, dis morning you said we was to clamp every— Not this cart, said Colon. Unlock it right now, and well say no more about it, eh? constable Chert seemed to reach the conclusion that he wasnt being paid to think, and this was just as well, because Sergeant Colon did not believe trolls gave value for money in that department. If you say so, Sarge  While youre doing that, me and All here will have a little chat, right, All? said Fred Colon. Thats right, Fred. Well, I say chat, but Ill be mostly listenin, on account of having my mouth full. Snow cascaded from the fir branches. The man forced his way through, stood fighting for breath for a moment and then set off across the clearing at a fast jog. Across the valley he heard the first blast on the horn. He had an hour, then, if he could trust them. He might not make it to the tower, but there were other ways out. He had plans. He could outwit them. Keep off the snow as much as you can, double back, make use of the streams it was possible, it had been done before. He was sure of that. A few miles away sleek bodies set out through the forest. The hunt was on. And elsewhere in Ankh-Morpork, the Fools Guild was on fire. This was a problem, because the Guilds fire brigade largely consisted of clowns. And this was a problem because, if you show a clown a bucket of water and a ladder, he knows only one way to act. Years of training take over. Its something in the red nose speaking to him. He cant help himself. Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch leaned against a wall and watched the show. We really must put that proposal for a civic fire service to the Patrician again, he said. Across the street, a clown picked up a ladder, turned, knocked the clown behind him into a bucket of water, then turned again to see what the commotion was, thus sending his rising victim into the bucket again with a surprising parping noise. The crowd watched silently. If it were funny, clowns wouldnt be doing it. The guilds are all against it, said Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson, his second in command, as the clown with the ladder had a bucket of water poured down his trousers. They say itd be trespass. The fire had taken hold in a first-floor room. If we let it burn itd be a blow for entertainment in this city, said Carrot earnestly. Vimes looked sideways at him. That was a true Carrot comment. It sounded as innocent as hell, but you could take it a different way. It certainly would, he said. Nevertheless, I suppose wed better do something. He stepped forward and cupped his hands. All right, this is the Watch Bucket chain he shouted. Aw, must we? said someone in the crowd. Yes, you must, said Captain Carrot. Come on, everyone, if we form two lines well have this done in no time at all What dyou say, eh? It might even be fun And they did it, Vimes noted. Carrot treated everyone as if they were jolly good chaps and somehow, in some inexplicable way, they couldnt resist the urge not to prove him wrong. And to the disappointment of the crowd the fire was soon put out, once the clowns were disarmed and led away by kind people. Carrot reappeared, wiping his forehead, as Vimes lit a cigar. Apparently the fire eater was sick, he said. Its just possible we might never be forgiven, said Vimes, as they set off on patrol again. Oh no what now? Carrot was staring upward, toward the nearest clacks tower. Riot in Cable Street, he said. Its All Officers, sir. They broke into a run. You always did for an All Officers. The people in trouble might well be you. There were more dwarfs on the streets as they got nearer, and Vimes recognized the signs. The dwarfs all wore preoccupied looks and were walking in the same direction. Its over, he said, as they rounded a corner. You can tell by the sudden increase in suspiciously innocent bystanders. Whatever else the emergency had been, it had been a big one. The street was strewn with debris, and a fair amount of dwarfs. Vimes slowed down. Third time this week, he said. Whats gotten into them? Hard to say, sir, said Carrot. Vimes shot him a glance. Carrot had been raised by dwarfs. He also, if he could possibly avoid it, never told a lie. That isnt the same as I dont know, is it, he said. The captain looked awkward. I think its sort of political, he said. Vimes noted a throwing ax buried in a wall. Yes, I can see that, he said. Someone was coming along the street, and was probably the reason why the riot had broken up. Lance-constable Bluejohn was the biggest troll Vimes had ever met. He loomed. He was so big that he didnt stand out in a crowd because he was the crowd; people failed to see him because he was in the way. And, like many overgrown people, he was instinctively gentle and rather shy and inclined to let others tell him what to do. If fate had led him to join a gang, hed be the muscle. In the Watch, he was the riot shield. Other watchmen were peering around him. Looks like it started in Gimlets Delicatessen, said Vimes, as the rest of the Watch moved in. Get a statement off Gimlet. Not a good idea, sir, said Carrot firmly. He didnt see anything. How do you know he didnt see anything? You havent asked him. I know, sir. He didnt see anything. He didnt hear anything, either. With a mob trashing his restaurant and scrapping in the street outside? Thats right, sir. Ah. I get it. Theres none so deaf as those that wont hear, are you saying? Something like that, sir, yes. Look, its all over, sir. I dont think anyones seriously hurt. Itll be for the best, sir. Please? Is this one of those private dwarf things, Captain? Yes, sir— Well, this is Ankh-Morpork, Captain, not some mine in the mountains, and its my job to keep the peace, and this, Captain, doesnt look like it. Whatre people going to say about rioting in the streets? Theyll say its another day in the life of the big city, sir, said Carrot woodenly. Yes, I suppose they would, at that. However— Vimes picked up a groaning dwarf. Who did this? he demanded. Im not in the mood for being messed around. Come on, I want a name Agi Hammerthief, muttered the dwarf, struggling. All right, said Vimes, letting him go. Write that down, Carrot. No, sir, said Carrot. Excuse me? There is no Agi Hammerthief in the city, sir. You know every dwarf? A lot of them, sir. But Agi Hammerthief is only found down mines, sir. Hes a sort of mischievous spirit, sir. For example, put it where Agi puts the coal,sir, means— Yes, I can guess, said Vimes. Youre telling me that dwarf just said this riot was started by Sweet Fanny Adams? The dwarf had disappeared smartly around a corner. More or less, sir. Excuse me a moment, sir. Carrot stepped across the street, pulling two white painted paddles out of his belt. Ill just get a line of sight on a tower, he said. Id better send a clacks. Why? Well, weve kept the Patrician waiting, sir, so itd be good manners to let him know were late. Vimes pulled out his watch and stared at it. It was turning out to be one of those days the sort that you got every day. It is in the nature of the universe that the person who always keeps you waiting ten minutes will, on the day you are ten minutes tardy, have been ready ten minutes early and will make a point of not mentioning this. Sorry were late, sir, said Vimes, as they entered the Oblong Office. Oh, are you late? said Lord Vetinari, looking up from his paperwork. I really hadnt noticed. Nothing serious, I trust. The Fools Guild caught fire, sir, said Carrot. Many casualties? No, sir. Well, that is a blessing, said Lord Vetinari carefully. He put down his pen. Now what do we have to discuss? He pulled another document toward him and read it swiftly. Ah I see that the new traffic division is having the desired effect. He indicated a large pile of paper. I am getting any amount of complaints from the Carters and Drovers Guild. Well done. Do pass on my thanks to Sergeant Colon and his team. I will, sir. I see in one day they clamped seventeen carts, ten horses, eighteen oxen and one duck. It was parked illegally, sir. Indeed. However, a strange pattern seems to emerge. Sir? Many of the carters say that they were not in fact parked but had merely halted while an extremely old and extremely ugly lady crossed the road extremely slowly. Thats their story, sir. They know she was an old lady by her constant litany on the lines of oh deary me, my poor old feet and similar expressions. Certainly sounds like an old lady to me, sir, said Vimes, his face still wooden. Quite so. What is rather strange is that several of them then report seeing the old lady subsequently legging it away along an alley rather fast. Id discount this, of course, were it not for the fact that the lady has apparently been seen crossing another street, very slowly, some distance away shortly afterward. Something of a mystery, Vimes. Vimes put his hand over his eyes. Its one I intend to solve quite quickly, sir. The Patrician nodded, and made a short note on the list in front of him. As he went to move it aside he uncovered a much grubbier, much folded scrap of paper. He picked up two letter knives and, using them fastidiously, unfolded the paper and inched it across the desk toward Vimes.'

const midl = 'The stranger demanded hospitality for the night which of course the fisherman dared not refuse. All the best they had was set before the Tarkaan for supper (and he didnt think much of it) and Shasta, as always happened when the fisherman had company, was given a hunk of bread and turned out of the cottage. On these occasions he usually slept with the donkey in its little thatched stable. But it was much too early to go to sleep yet, and Shasta, who had never learned that it is wrong to listen behind doors, sat down with his ear to a crack in the wooden wall of the cottage to hear what the grown-ups were talking about. And this is what he heard. And now, O my host, said the Tarkaan, I have a mind to buy that boy of yours. O my master, replied the fisherman (and Shasta knew by the wheedling tone the greedy look that was probably coming into his face as he said it), what price could induce your servant, poor though he is, to sell into slavery his only child and his own flesh? Has not one of the poets said, `Natural affection is stronger than soup and offspring more precious than carbuncles? It is even so, replied the guest dryly. But another poet has likewise said, He who attempts to deceive the judicious is already baring his own back for the scourge. Do not load your aged mouth with falsehoods. This boy is manifestly no son of yours, for your cheek is as dark as mine but the boy is fair and white like the accursed but beautiful barbarians who inhabit the remote North. How well it was said, answered the fisherman, that Swords can be kept off with shields but the Eye of Wisdom pierces through every defence Know then, O my formidable guest, that because of my extreme poverty I have never married and have no child. But in that same year in which the Tisroc (may he live for ever) began his august and beneficent reign, on a night when the moon was at her full, it pleased the gods to deprive me of my sleep. Therefore I arose from my bed in this hovel and went forth to the beach to refresh myself with looking upon the water and the moon and breathing the cool air. And presently I heard a noise as of oars coming to me across the water and then, as it were, a weak cry. And shortly after, the tide brought to the land a little boat in which there was nothing but a man lean with extreme hunger and thirst who seemed to have died but a few moments before (for he was still warm), and an empty water-skin, and a child, still living. Doubtless, said I, these unfortunates have escaped from the wreck of a great ship, but by the admirable designs of the gods, the elder has starved himself to keep the child alive and has perished in sight of land. Accordingly, remembering how the gods never fail to reward those who befriend the destitute, and being moved by compassion (for your servant is a man of tender heart) - Leave out all these idle words in your own praise, interrupted the Tarkaan. It is enough to know that you took the child - and have had ten times the worth of his daily bread out of him in labour, as anyone can see. And now tell me at once what price you put on him, for I am wearied with your loquacity. You yourself have wisely said, answered Arsheesh, that the boys labour has been to me of inestimable value. This must be taken into account in fixing the price. For if I sell the boy I must undoubtedly either buy or hire another to do his work. Ill give you fifteen crescents for him, said the Tarkaan. Fifteen cried Arsheesh in a voice that was something between a whine and a scream. Fifteen For the prop of my old age and the delight of my eyes Do not mock my grey beard, Tarkaan though you be. My price is seventy. At this point Shasta got up and tiptoed away. He had heard all he wanted, for he had open listened when men were bargaining in the village and knew how it was done. He was quite certain that Arsheesh would sell him in the end for something much more than fifteen crescents and much less than seventy, but that he and the Tarkaan would take hours in getting to an agreement. You must not imagine that Shasta felt at all as you and I would feel if we had just overheard our parents talking about selling us for slaves. For one thing, his life was already little better than slavery; for all he knew, the lordly stranger on the great horse might be kinder to him than Arsheesh. For another, the story about his own discovery in the boat had filled him with excitement and with a sense of relief. He had often been uneasy because, try as he might, he had never been able to love the fisherman, and he knew that a boy ought to love his father. And now, apparently, he was no relation to Arsheesh at all. That took a great weight off his mind. Why, I might be anyone he thought. I might be the son of a Tarkaan myself - or the son of the Tisroc (may he live for ever) or of a god He was standing out in the grassy place before the cottage while he thought these things. Twilight was coming on apace and a star or two was already out, but the remains of the sunset could still be seen in the west. Not far away the strangers horse, loosely tied to an iron ring in the wall of the donkeys stable, was grazing. Shasta strolled over to it and patted its neck. It went on tearing up the grass and took no notice of him. Then another thought came into Shastas mind. I wonder what sort of a man that Tarkaan is, he said out loud. It would be splendid if he was kind. Some of the slaves in a great lords house have next to nothing to do. They wear lovely clothes and eat meat every day. Perhaps hed take me to the wars and Id save his life in a battle and then hed set me free and adopt me as his son and give me a palace and a chariot and a suit of armour. But then he might be a horrid cruel man. He might send me to work on the fields in chains. I wish I knew. How can I know? I bet this horse knows, if only he could tell me. The Horse had lifted its head. Shasta stroked its smooth-as-satin nose and said, I wish you could talk, old fellow. And then for a second he thought he was dreaming, for quite distinctly, though in a low voice, the Horse said, But I can. Shasta stared into its great eyes and his own grew almost as big, with astonishment. How ever did you learn to talk? he asked. Hush Not so loud, replied the Horse. Where I come from, nearly all the animals talk. Wherever is that? asked Shasta. Narnia, answered the Horse. The happy land of Narnia - Narnia of the heathery mountains and the thymy downs, Narnia of the many rivers, the plashing glens, the mossy caverns and the deep forests ringing with the hammers of the Dwarfs. Oh the sweet air of Narnia An hours life there is better than a thousand years in Calormen. It ended with a whinny that sounded very like a sigh. How did you get here? said Shasta. Kidnapped, said the Horse. Or stolen, or captured whichever you like to call it. I was only a foal at the time. My mother warned me not to range the Southern slopes, into Archenland and beyond, but I wouldnt heed her. And by the Lions Mane I have paid for my folly. All these years I have been a slave to humans, hiding my true nature and pretending to be dumb and witless like their horses. Why didnt you tell them who you were? Not such a fool, thats why. If theyd once found out I could talk they would have made a show of me at fairs and guarded me more carefully than ever. My last chance of escape would have been gone. And why - began Shasta, but the Horse interrupted him. Now look, it said, we mustnt waste time on idle questions. You want to know about my master the Tarkaan Anradin. Well, hes bad. Not too bad to me, for a war horse costs too much to be treated very badly. But youd better be lying dead tonight than go to be a human slave in his house tomorrow. Then Id better run away, said Shasta, turning very pale. Yes, you had, said the Horse. But why not run away with me? Are you going to run away too? said Shasta. Yes, if youll come with me, answered the Horse. This is the chance for both of us. You see if I run away without a rider, everyone who sees me will say Stray horse and be after me as quick as he can. With a rider Ive a chance to get through. Thats where you can help me. On the other hand, you cant get very far on those two silly legs of yours (what absurd legs humans have) without being overtaken. But on me you can outdistance any other horse in this country. Thats where I can help you. By the way, I suppose you know how to ride? Oh yes, of course, said Shasta. At least, Ive ridden the donkey. Ridden the what? retorted the Horse with extreme contempt. (At least, that is what he meant. Actually it came out in a sort of neigh - Ridden the wha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Talking horses always become more horsy in accent when they are angry.) In other words, it continued, you cant ride. Thats a drawback. Ill have to teach you as we go along. If you cant ride, can you fall? I suppose anyone can fall, said Shasta. 1 mean can you fall and get up again without crying and mount again and fall again and yet not be afraid of falling? I - Ill try, said Shasta. Poor little beast, said the Horse in a gentler tone. I forget youre only a foal. Well make a fine rider of you in time. And now - we mustnt start until those two in the but are asleep. Meantime we can make our plans. My Tarkaan is on his way North to the great city, to Tashbaan itself and the court of the Tisroc - I say, put in Shasta in rather a shocked voice, oughtnt you to say `May he live for ever? Why? asked the Horse. Im a free Narnian. And why should I talk slaves and fools talk? I dont want him to live for ever, and I know that hes not going to live for ever whether I want him to or not. And I can see youre from the free North too. No more of this Southern jargon between you and me And now, back to our plans. As I said, my human was on his way North to Tashbaan. Does that mean wed better go to the South? I think not, said the Horse. You see, he thinks Im dumb and witless like his other horses. Now if I really were, the moment I got loose Id go back home to my stable'

const midm = 'and paddock; back to his palace which is two days journey South. Thats where hell look for me. Hed never dream of my going on North on my own. And anyway he will probably think that someone in the last village who saw him ride through has followed us to here and stolen me. Oh hurrah said Shasta. Then well go North. Ive been longing to go to the North all my life. Of course you have, said the Horse. Thats because of the blood thats in you. Im sure youre true Northern stock. But not too loud. I should think theyd be asleep soon now. Id better creep back and see, suggested Shasta. Thats a good idea, said the Horse. But take care youre not caught. It was a good deal darker now and very silent except for the sound of the waves on the beach, which Shasta hardly noticed because he had been hearing it day and night as long as he could remember. The cottage, as he approached it, showed no light. When he listened at the front there was no noise. When he went round to the only window, he could hear, after a second or two, the familiar noise of the old fishermans squeaky snore. It was funny to think that if all went well he would never hear it again. Holding his breath and feeling a little bit sorry, but much less sorry than he was glad, Shasta glided away over the grass and went to the donkeys stable, groped along to a place he knew where the key was hidden, opened the door and found the Horses saddle and bridle which had been locked up there for the night. He bent forward and kissed the donkeys nose. Im sorry we cant take you, he said. There you are at last, said the Horse when he got back to it. I was beginning to wonder what had become of you. I was getting your things out of the stable, replied Shasta. And now, can you tell me how to put them on? For the next few minutes Shasta was at work, very cautiously to avoid jingling, while the Horse said things like, Get that girth a bit tighter, or Youll find a buckle lower down, or Youll need to shorten those stirrups a good bit. When all was finished it said: Now; weve got to have reins for the look of the thing, but you wont be using them. Tie them to the saddle-bow: very slack so that I can do what I like with my head. And, remember - you are not to touch them. What are they for, then? asked Shasta. Ordinarily they are for directing me, replied the Horse. But as I intend to do all the directing on this journey, youll please keep your hands to yourself. And theres another thing. Im not going to have you grabbing my mane. But I say, pleaded Shasta. If Im not to hold on by the reins or by your mane, what am I to hold on by? You hold on with your knees, said the Horse. Thats the secret of good riding. Grip my body between your knees as hard as you like; sit straight up, straight as a poker; keep your elbows in. And by the way, what did you do with the spurs? Put them on my heels, of course, said Shasta. I do know that much. Then you can take them off and put them in the saddlebag. We may be able to sell them when we get to Tashbaan. Ready? And now I think you can get up. Ooh Youre a dreadful height, gasped Shasta after his first, and unsuccessful, attempt. Im a horse, thats all, was the reply. Anyone would think I was a haystack from the way youre trying to climb up me There, thats better. Now sit up and remember what I told you about your knees. Funny to think of me who has led cavalry charges and won races having a potato-sack like you in the saddle However, off we go. It chuckled, not unkindly. And it certainly began their night journey with great caution. First of all it went just south of the fishermans cottage to the little river which there ran into the sea, and took care to leave in the mud some very plain hoof-marks pointing South. But as soon as they were in the middle of the ford it turned upstream and waded till they were about a hundred yards farther inland than the cottage. Then it selected a nice gravelly bit of bank which would take no footprints and came out on the Northern side. Then, still at a walking pace, it went Northward till the cottage, the one tree, the donkeys stable, and the creek - everything, in fact, that Shasta had ever known - had sunk out of sight in the grey summer-night darkness. They had been going uphill and now were at the top of the ridge - that ridge which had always been the boundary of Shastas known world. He could not see what was ahead except that it was all open and grassy. It looked endless: wild and lonely and free. I say observed the Horse. What a place for a gallop, eh Oh dont lets, said Shasta. Not yet. I dont know how to - please, Horse. I dont know your name. Breehy-hinny-brinny-hooky-hah, said the Horse. Ill never be able to say that, said Shasta. Can I call you Bree? Well, if its the best you can do, I suppose you must, said the Horse. And what shall I call you? Im called Shasta. Hm, said Bree. Well, now, theres a name thats really hard to pronounce. But now about this gallop. Its a good deal easier than trotting if you only knew, because you dont have to rise and fall. Grip with your knees and keep your eyes straight ahead between my ears. Dont look at the ground. If you think youre going to fall just grip harder and sit up straighter. Ready? Now: for Narnia and the North. CHAPTER TWO A WAYSIDE ADVENTURE IT was nearly noon on the following day when Shasta was wakened by something warm and soft moving over his face. He opened his eyes and found himself staring into the long face of a horse; its nose and lips were almost touching his. He remembered the exciting events of the previous night and sat up. But as he did so he groaned. Ow, Bree, he gasped. Im so sore. All over. I can hardly move. Good morning, small one, said Bree. I was afraid you might feel a bit stiff. It cant be the falls. You didnt have more than a dozen or so, and it was all lovely, soft springy turf that must have been almost a pleasure to fall on. And the only one that might have been nasty was broken by that gorse bush. No: its the riding itself that comes hard at first. What about breakfast? Ive had mine. Oh bother breakfast. Bother everything, said Shasta. I tell you I cant move. But the horse nuzzled at him with its nose and pawed him gently with a hoof till he had to get up. And then he looked about him and saw where they were. Behind them lay a little copse. Before them the turf, dotted with white flowers, sloped down to the brow of a cliff. Far below them, so that the sound of the breaking waves was very faint, lay the sea. Shasta had never seen it from such a height and never seen so much of it before, nor dreamed how many colours it had. On either hand the coast stretched away, headland after headland, and at the points you could see the white foam running up the rocks but making no noise because it was so far off. There were gulls flying overhead and the heat shivered on the ground; it was a blazing day. But what Shasta chiefly noticed was the air. He couldnt think what was missing, until at last he realized that there was no smell of fish in it. For of course, neither in the cottage nor among the nets, had he ever been away from that smell in his life. And this new air was so delicious, and all his old life seemed so far away, that he forgot for a moment about his bruises and his aching muscles and said: I say, Bree, didnt you say something about breakfast? Yes, I did, answered Bree. I think youll find something in the saddle-bags. Theyre over there on that tree where you hung them up last night - or early this morning, rather. They investigated the saddle-bags and the results were cheering- a meat pasty, only slightly stale, a lump of dried figs and another lump of green cheese, a little flask of wine, and some money; about forty crescents in all, which was more than Shasta had ever seen. While Shasta sat down - painfully and cautiously - with his back against a tree and started on the pasty, Bree had a few more mouthfuls of grass to keep him company. Wont it be stealing to use the money? asked Shasta. Oh, said the Horse, looking up with its mouth full of grass, I never thought of that. A free horse and a talking horse mustnt steal, of course. But I think its all right. Were prisoners and captives in enemy country. That money is booty, spoil. Besides, how are we to get any food for you without it? I suppose, like all humans, you wont eat natural food like grass and oats. I cant. Ever tried? Yes, I have. I cant get it down at all. You couldnt either if you were me. Youre rum little creatures, you humans, remarked Bree. When Shasta had finished his breakfast (which was by far the nicest he had ever eaten), Bree said, I think Ill have a nice roll before we put on that saddle again. And he proceeded to do so. Thats good. Thats very good, he said, rubbing his back on the turf and waving all four legs in the air. You ought to have one too, Shasta, he snorted. Its most refreshing. But Shasta burst out laughing and said,You do look funny when youre on your back I look nothing of the sort, said Bree. But then suddenly he rolled round on his side, raised his head and looked hard at Shasta, blowing a little. Does it really look funny? he asked in an anxious voice. Yes, it does, replied Shasta. But what does it matter? You dont think, do you, said Bree, that it might be a thing talking horses never do - a silly, clownish trick Ive learned from the dumb ones? It would be dreadful to find, when I get back to Narnia, that Ive picked up a lot of low, bad habits. What do you think, Shasta? Honestly, now. Dont spare my feelings. Should you think the real, free horses - the talking kind - do roll? How should I know? Anyway I dont think I should bother about it if I were you. Weve got to get there first. Do you know the way? I know my way to Tashbaan. After that comes the desert. Oh, well manage the desert somehow, never fear. Why, well be in sight of the Northern mountains then. Think of it To Narnia and the North Nothing will stop us then. But Id be glad to be past Tashbaan. You and I are safer away from cities. Cant we avoid it? Not without going along way inland, and that would take us into cultivated land and main roads; and I wouldnt know the way. No, well just have to creep along the coast. Up here on the downs well meet nothing but sheep and rabbits and gulls and a few shepherds. And by the way, what about starting? Shastas legs ached terribly as he saddled Bree and climbed into the saddle, but the Horse was kindly to him and went at a soft pace all afternoon. When evening twilight came they dropped by steep tracks into a valley and found a village. Before they got into it Shasta dismounted and entered it on foot to buy a loaf and some onions and radishes. The Horse trotted round by the fields in the dusk and met Shasta at the far side. This became their regular plan every second night. These were great days for Shasta, and every day better than the last as his muscles hardened and he fell less often. Even at the end of his training Bree still said he sat like a bag of flour in the saddle. And even if it was safe, young un, Id be ashamed to be seen with you on the main road. But in spite of his rude words Bree was a patient teacher. No one can teach riding so well as a horse. Shasta learned to trot, to canter, to jump, and to keep his seat even when Bree pulled up suddenly or swung unexpectedly to the left or the right - which, as Bree told him, was a thing you might have to do at any moment in a battle. And then of course Shasta begged to be told of the battles and wars in which Bree had carried the Tarkaan. And Bree would tell of forced marches and the fording of swift rivers, of charges and of fierce fights between cavalry and cavalry when the war horses fought as well as the men, being all fierce stallions, trained to bite and kick, and to rear at the right moment so that the horses weight as well as the riders would come down on a enemys crest in the stroke of sword or battleaxe. But Bree did not want to talk about the wars as often as Shasta wanted to hear about them. Dont speak of them, youngster, he would say. They were only the Tisrocs wars and I fought in them as a slave and a dumb beast. Give me the Narnian wars where I shall fight as a free Horse among my own people Those will be wars worth talking about. Narnia and the North Bra-ha-ha Broo hoo Shasta soon learned, when he heard Bree talking like that, to prepare for a gallop. After they had travelled on for weeks and weeks past more bays and headlands and rivers and villages than Shasta could remember, there came a moonlit night when they started their journey at evening, having slept during the day. They had left the downs behind them and were crossing a wide plain with a forest about half a mile away on their left. The sea, hidden by low sandhills, was about the same distance on their right. They had jogged along for about an hour, sometimes trotting and sometimes walking, when Bree suddenly stopped. Whats up? said Shasta. S-s-ssh said Bree, craning his neck round and twitching his ears. Did you hear something? Listen. It sounds like another horse - between us and the wood, said Shasta after he had listened for about a minute. It is another horse, said Bree. And thats what I dont like. Isnt it probably just a farmer riding home late? said Shasta with a yawn. Dont tell me said Bree. Thats not a farmers riding. Nor a farmers horse either. Cant you tell by the sound? Thats quality, that horse is. And its being ridden by a real horseman. I tell you what it is, Shasta. Theres a Tarkaan under the edge of that wood. Not on his war horse - its too light for that. On a fine blood mare, I should say. Well, its stopped now, whatever it is, said Shasta. Youre right, said Bree. And why should he stop just when we do? Shasta, my boy, I do believe theres someone shadowing us at last. What shall we do? said Shasta in a lower whisper than before. Do you think he can see us as well as hear us? Not in this light so long as we stay quite still, answered Bree. But look Theres a cloud coming up. Ill wait till that gets over the moon. Then well get off to our right as quietly as we can, down to the shore. We can hide among the sandhills if the worst comes to the worst. They waited till the cloud covered the moon and then, first'

const midn = 'at a walking pace and afterwards at a gentle trot, made for the shore. The cloud was bigger and thicker than it had looked at first and soon the night grew very dark. Just as Shasta was saying to himself, We must be nearly at those sandhills by now, his heart leaped into his mouth because an appalling noise had suddenly risen up out of the darkness ahead; a long snarling roar, melancholy and utterly savage. Instantly Bree swerved round and began galloping inland again as fast as he could gallop. What is it? gasped Shasta. Lions said Bree, without checking his pace or turning his head. After that there was nothing but sheer galloping for some time. At last they splashed across a wide, shallow stream and Bree came to a stop on the far side. Shasta noticed that he was trembling and sweating all over. That water may have thrown the brute off our scent, panted Bree when he had partly got his breath again. We can walk for a bit now. As they walked Bree said, Shasta, Im ashamed of myself. Im just as frightened as a common, dumb Calor mene horse. I am really. I dont feel like a Talking Horse at all. I dont mind swords and lances and arrows but I cant bear - those creatures. I think Ill trot for a bit. About a minute later, however, he broke into a gallop again, and no wonder. For the roar broke out again, this time on their left from the direction of the forest. Two of them, moaned Bree. When they had galloped for several minutes without any further noise from the lions Shasta said, I say That other horse is galloping beside us now. Only a stones throw away. All the b-better, panted Bree. Tarkaan on it - will have a sword - protect us all. But, Bree said Shasta. We might just as well be killed by lions as caught. Or 1 might. Theyll hang me for horsestealing. He was feeling less frightened of lions than Bree because he had never met a lion; Bree had. Bree only snorted in answer but he did sheer away to his right. Oddly enough the other horse seemed also to be sheering away to the left, so that in a few seconds the space between them had widened a good deal. But as soon as it did so there came two more lions roars, immediately after one another, one on the right and the other on the left, the horses began drawing nearer together. So, apparently, did the lions. The roaring of the brutes on each side was horribly close and they seemed to be keeping up with the galloping horses quite easily. Then the cloud rolled away. The moonlight, astonishingly bright, showed up everything almost as if it were broad day. The two horses and two riders were galloping neck to neck and knee to knee just as if they were in a race. Indeed Bree said (afterwards) that a finer race had never been seen in Calormen. Shasta now gave himself up for lost and began to wonder whether lions killed you quickly or played with you as a cat plays with a mouse and how much it would hurt. At the same time (one sometimes does this at the most frightful moments) he noticed everything. He saw that the other rider was a very small, slender person, mail-clad (the moon shone on the mail) and riding magnificently. He had no beard. Something flat and shining was spread out before them. Before Shasta had time even to guess what it was there was a great splash and he found his mouth half full of salt water. The shining thing had been a long inlet of the sea. Both horses were swimming and the water was up to Shastas knees. There was an angry roaring behind them and looking back Shasta saw a great, shaggy, and terrible shape crouched on the waters edge; but only one. We must have shaken off the other lion, he thought. The lion apparently did not think its prey worth a wetting; at any rate it made no attempt to take the water in pursuit. The two horses, side by side, were now well out into the middle of the creek and the opposite shore could be clearly seen. The Tarkaan had not yet spoken a word. But he will, thought Shasta. As soon as we have landed. What am I to say? I must begin thinking out a story. Then, suddenly, two voices spoke at his side. Oh, I am so tired, said the one. Hold your tongue, Hwin, and dont be a fool, said the other. Im dreaming, thought Shasta. I could have sworn that other horse spoke. Soon the horses were no longer swimming but walking and soon with a great sound of water running off their sides and tails and with a great crunching of pebbles under eight hoofs, they came out on the farther beach of the inlet. The Tarkaan, to Shastas surprise, showed no wish to ask questions. He did not even look at Shasta but seemed anxious to urge his horse straight on. Bree, however, at once shouldered himself in the other horses way. Broo-hoo-hah he snorted. Steady there I heard you, I did. Theres no good pretending, Maam. 1 heard you. Youre a Talking Horse, a Narnian horse just like me. Whats it got to do with you if she is? said the strange rider fiercely, laying hand on sword-hilt. But the voice in which the words were spoken had already told Shasta something. Why, its only a girl he exclaimed. And what business is it of yours if I am only a girl? snapped the stranger. Youre probably only a boy: a rude, common little boy - a slave probably, whos stolen his masters horse. Thats all you know, said Shasta. Hes not a thief, little Tarkheena, said Bree. At least, if theres been any stealing, you might just as well say I stole him. And as for its not being my business, you wouldnt expect me to pass a lady of my own race in this strange country without speaking to her? Its only natural I should. I think its very natural too, said the mare. I wish youd held your tongue, Hwin, said the girl. Look at the trouble youve got us into. I dont know about trouble, said Shasta. You can clear off as soon as you like. We shant keep you. No, you shant, said the girl. What quarrelsome creatures these humans are, said Bree to the mare. Theyre as bad as mules. Lets try to talk a little sense. I take it, maam, your story is the same as mine? Captured in early youth - years of slavery among the Calormenes? Too true, sir, said the mare with a melancholy whinny. And now, perhaps - escape? Tell him to mind his own business, Hwin, said the girl. No, I wont, Aravis, said the mare putting her ears back. This is my escape just as much as yours. And Im sure a noble war-horse like this is not going to betray us. We are trying to escape, to get to Narnia. And so, of course, are we, said Bree. Of course you guessed that at once. A little boy in rags riding (or trying to ride) a war-horse at dead of night couldnt mean anything but an escape of some sort. And, if I may say so, a highborn Tarkheena riding alone at night - dressed up in her brothers armour - and very anxious for everyone to mind their own business and ask her no questions - well, if thats not fishy, call me a cob All right then, said Aravis. Youve guessed it. Hwin and I are running away. We are trying to get to Narnia. And now, what about it? Why, in that case, what is to prevent us all going together? said Bree. I trust, Madam Hwin, you will accept such assistance and protection as I may be able to give you on the journey? Why do you keep talking to my horse instead of to me? asked the girl. Excuse me, Tarkheena, said Bree (with just the slightest backward tilt of his ears), but thats Calormene talk. Were free Narnians, Hwin and I, and I suppose, if youre running away to Narnia, you want to be one too. In that case Hwin isnt your horse any longer. One might just as well say youre her human. The girl opened her mouth to speak and then stopped. Obviously she had not quite seen it in that light before. Still, she said after a moments pause, I dont know that theres so much point in all going together. Arent we more likely to be noticed? Less, said Bree; and the mare said, Oh do lets. I should feel much more comfortable. Were not even certain of the way. Im sure a great charger like this knows far more than we do. Oh come on, Bree, said Shasta, and let them go their own way. Cant you see they dont want us? We do, said Hwin. Look here, said the girl. I dont mind going with Are there Capitol hoverplanes speeding in to blow us out of the sky? As we travel over District 12, Iwatch anxiously for signs of an attack, but nothing pursues us.After several minutes, when I hear an exchange between Plutarch and the pilot confirming that the airspace is clear, I begin to relax a little. Gale nods at the howls coming from my game bag. Now I know why you had to go back. If there was even a chance of his recovery. I dump the bag onto a seat, where the loathsome creature begins a low, deep-throated growl. Oh, shut up, I tell the bag as I sink into the cushioned window seat across from it. Gale sits next to me. Pretty bad down there? Couldnt be much worse, I answer. I look in his eyes and see my own grief reflected there. Our hands find each other, holding fast to a part of 12 that Snow has somehow failed to destroy. We sit in silence for the rest of the trip to 13, which only takes about forty-five minutes.A mere weeks journey on foot. Bonnie and Twill, the District 8 refugees who I encountered in the woods last winter, werent so far from their destination after all. They apparently didnt make it, though. When I asked about them in 13, no one seemed to know who Iwas talking about. Died in the woods, I guess. From the air, 13 looks about as cheerful as 12. The rubble isnt smoking, the way the Capitol shows it on television, but theres next to no life aboveground. In the seventy-five years since the Dark Days- when 13 was said to have been obliterated in the war between the Capitol and the districts- almost all new construction has been beneath the earths surface. There was already a substantial underground facility here, developed over centuries to be either a clandestine refuge for government leaders in time of war or a last resort for humanity if life above became unlivable. Most important for the people of 13, it was the center of the Capitols nuclear weapons development program. During the Dark Days, the rebels in 13 wrested control from the government forces, trained their nuclear missiles on the Capitol, and then struck a bargain: They would play dead in exchange for being left alone. The Capitol had another nuclear arsenal out west, but it couldnt attack 13 without certain retaliation. It was forced to accept 13s deal. The Capitol demolished the visible remains of the district and cut off all access from the outside. Perhaps the Capitols leaders thought that, without help, 13 would die off on its own. It almost did a few times, but it always managed to pull through due to strict sharing of resources, strenuous discipline, and constant vigilance against any further attacks from the Capitol. Now the citizens live almost exclusively underground. You can go outside for exercise and sunlight but only at very'

const mido = 'specific times in your schedule. You cant miss your schedule. Every morning, youre supposed to stick your right arm in this contraption in the wall. It tattoos the smooth inside of your forearm with your schedule for the day in a sickly purple ink. 7:00--Breakfast. 7:30--Kitchen Duties. 8:30--Education Center, Room 17.And so on. The ink is indelible until 22:00--Bathing. Thats when whatever keeps it water resistant breaks down and the whole schedule rinses away. The lights-out at 22:30 signals that everyone not on the night shift should be in bed. At first, when Iwas so ill in the hospital, I could forgo being imprinted. But once Imoved into Compartment 307 with my mother and sister, Iwas expected to get with the program. Except for showing up for meals, though, I pretty much ignore the words on my arm. I just go back to our compartment or wander around 13 or fall asleep somewhere hidden.An abandoned air duct. Behind the water pipes in the laundry. Theres a closet in the Education Center thats great because no one ever seems to need school supplies. Theyre so frugal with things here, waste is practically a criminal activity. Fortunately, the people of 12 have never been wasteful. But once I saw Fulvia Cardew crumple up a sheet of paper with just a couple of words written on it and you wouldve thought shed murdered someone from the looks she got. Her face turned tomato red, making the silver flowers inlaid in her plump cheeks even more noticeable. The very portrait of excess. One of my few pleasures in 13 is watching the handful of pampered Capitol rebels squirming as they try to fit in. I dont know how long Ill be able to get away with my complete disregard for the clockwork precision of attendance required by my hosts. Right now, they leave me alone because Im classified as mentally disorientedit says so right on my plastic medical bracelet- and everyone has to tolerate my ramblings. But that cant last forever. Neither can their patience with the Mockingjay issue. From the landing pad, Gale and Iwalk down a series of stairways to Compartment 307. We could take the elevator, only it reminds me too much of the one that lifted me into the arena. Im having a hard time adjusting to being underground so much. But after the surreal encounter with the rose, for the first time the descent makes me feel safer. I hesitate at the door marked 307, anticipating the questions from my family. What am I going to tell them about Twelve? I ask Gale. I doubt theyll ask for details. They saw it burn. Theyll mostly be worried about how youre handling it. Gale touches my cheek. Like I am. I press my face against his hand for a moment. Ill survive. Then I take a deep breath and open the door. My mother and sister are home for 18:00--Reflection, a half hour of downtime before dinner. I see the concern on their faces as they try to gauge my emotional state. Before anyone can ask anything, I empty my game bag and it becomes 18:00--CatAdoration. Prim just sits on the floor weeping and rocking that awful Buttercup, who interrupts his purring only for an occasional hiss at me. He gives me a particularly smug look when she ties the blue ribbon around his neck. My mother hugs the wedding photo tightly against her chest and then places it, along with the book of plants, on our government-issued chest of drawers. I hang my fathers jacket on the back of a chair. For a moment, the place almost seems like home. So I guess the trip to 12 wasnt a complete waste. Were heading down to the dining hall for 18:30--Dinner whenGales communicuff begins to beep. It looks like an oversized watch, but it receives print messages. Being granted a communicuff is a special privilege thats reserved for those important to the cause, a status Gale achieved by his rescue of the citizens of 12. They need the two of us in Command, he says. Trailing a few steps behind Gale, I try to collect myself before Im thrown into whats sure to be another relentless Mockingjay session. I linger in the doorway of Command, the high-tech meeting/war council room complete with computerized talking walls, electronic maps showing the troop movements in various districts, and a giant rectangular table with control panels Im not supposed to touch. No one notices me, though, because theyre all gathered at a television screen at the far end of the room that airs the Capitol broadcast around the clock. Im thinking Imight be able to slip away when Plutarch, whose ample frame has been blocking the television, catches sight of me and waves urgently for me to join them. Ireluctantly move forward, trying to imagine how it could be of interest to me. Its always the same. War footage. Propaganda. Replaying the bombings of District 12.An ominous message from President Snow. So its almost entertaining to see Caesar Flickerman, the eternal host of the Hunger Games, with his painted face and sparkly suit, preparing to give an interview. Until the camera pulls back and I see that his guest is Peeta. A sound escapes me. The same combination of gasp and groan that comes from being submerged in water, deprived of oxygen to the point of pain. I push people aside until I am right in front of him, my hand resting on the screen. I search his eyes for any sign of hurt, any reflection of the agony of torture. There is nothing. Peeta looks healthy to the point of robustness. His skin is glowing, flawless, in that full-body-polish way. His manners composed, serious. I cant reconcile this image with the battered, bleeding boy who haunts my dreams. Caesar settles himself more comfortably in the chair across from Peeta and gives him a long look. So...Peeta...welcome back. Peeta smiles slightly. I bet you thought youd done your last interview with me, Caesar. I confess, I did, says Caesar. The night before the Quarter Quell...well, who ever thought wed see you again? It wasnt part of my plan, thats for sure, says Peeta with a frown. Caesar leans in to him a little. I think it was clear to all of us what your plan was. To sacrifice yourself in the arena so that Katniss Everdeen and your child could survive. That was it. Clear and simple. Peetas fingers trace the upholstered pattern on the arm of the chair. But other people had plans as well. Yes, other people had plans, I think. Has Peeta guessed, then, how the rebels used us as pawns? How my rescue was arranged from the beginning? And finally, how our mentor, HaymitchAbernathy, betrayed us both for a cause he pretended to have no interest in? In the silence that follows, I notice the lines that have formed between Peetas eyebrows. He has guessed or he has been told. But the Capitol has not killed or even punished him. For right now, that exceeds my wildest hopes. I drink in his wholeness, the soundness of his body and mind. It runs through me like the morphling they give me in the hospital, dulling the pain of the last weeks. Why dont you tell us about that last night in the arena? suggests Caesar. Help us sort a few things out. Peeta nods but takes his time speaking. That last night...to tell you about that last night...well, first of all, you have to imagine how it felt in the arena. It was like being an insect trapped under a bowl filled with steaming air.And all around you, jungle...green and alive and ticking. That giant clock ticking away your life. Every hour promising some new horror. You have to imagine that in the past two days, sixteen people have died- some of them defending you.At the rate things are going, the last eight will be dead by morning. Save one. The victor. And your plan is that it wont be you. My body breaks out in a sweat at the memory.'

const midp = 'My hand slides down the screen and hangs limply at my side. Peeta doesnt need a brush to paint images from the Games. He works just as well in words. Once youre in the arena, the rest of the world becomes very distant, he continues. All the people and things you loved or cared about almost cease to exist. The pink sky and the monsters in the jungle and the tributes who want your blood become your final reality, the only one that ever mattered.As bad as it makes you feel, youre going to have to do some killing, because in the arena, you only get one wish.And its very costly. It costs your life, says Caesar. Oh, no. It costs a lot more than your life. To murder innocent people? says Peeta. It costs everything you are. Everything you are, repeats Caesar quietly. A hush has fallen over the room, and I can feel it spreading across Panem.A nation leaning in toward its screens. Because no one has ever talked about what its really like in the arena before. Peeta goes on. So you hold on to your wish.And that last night, yes, my wish was to save Katniss. But even without knowing about the rebels, it didnt feel right. Everything was too complicated. I found myself regretting I hadnt run off with her earlier in the day, as she had suggested. But there was no getting out of it at that point. You were too caught up in Beetees plan to electrify the salt lake, says Caesar. Too busy playing allies with the others. I should have never let them separate us Peeta bursts out. Thats when I lost her. When you stayed at the lightning tree, and she and Johanna Mason took the coil of wire down to the water, Caesar clarifies. I didnt want to Peeta flushes in agitation. But I couldnt argue with Beetee without indicating we were about to break away from the alliance. When that wire was cut, everything just went insane. I can only remember bits and pieces. Trying to find her. Watching Brutus kill Chaff. Killing Brutus myself. I know she was calling my name. Then the lightning bolt hit the tree, and the force field around the arena...blew out. Katniss blew it out, Peeta, says Caesar. Youve seen the footage. She didnt know what she was doing. None of us could follow Beetees plan. You can see her trying to figure out what to do with that wire, Peeta snaps back. All right. It just looks suspicious, says Caesar. As if she was part of the rebels plan all along. Peetas on his feet, leaning in to Caesars face, hands locked on the arms of his interviewers chair. Really? And was it part of her plan for Johanna to nearly kill her? For that electric shock to paralyze her? To trigger the bombing? Hes yelling now. She didnt know, Caesar Neither of us knew anything except that we were trying to keep each other alive Caesar places his hand on Peetas chest in a gesture thats both self-protective and conciliatory. Okay, Peeta, I believe you. Okay. Peeta withdraws from Caesar, pulling back his hands, running them through his hair, mussing his carefully styled blond curls. He slumps back in his chair, distraught. Caesar waits a moment, studying Peeta. What about your mentor, HaymitchAbernathy? Peetas face hardens. I dont know what Haymitch knew. Could he have been part of the conspiracy? asks Caesar. He never mentioned it, says Peeta. Caesar presses on. What does your heart tell you? That I shouldnt have trusted him, says Peeta. Thats all. I havent seen Haymitch since I attacked him on the hovercraft, leaving long claw marks down his face. I know its been bad for him here. District 13 strictly forbids any production or consumption of intoxicating beverages, and even the rubbing alcohol in the hospital is kept under lock and key. Finally, Haymitch is being beverages, and even the rubbing alcohol in the hospital is kept under lock and key. Finally, Haymitch is being forced into sobriety, with no secret stashes or home-brewed concoctions to ease his transition. Theyve got him in seclusion until hes dried out, as hes not deemed fit for public display. It must be excruciating, but I lost all my sympathy for Haymitch when Irealized how he had deceived us. I hope hes watching the Capitol broadcast now, so he can see that Peeta has cast him off as well. Caesar pats Peetas shoulder. We can stop now if you want. Was there more to discuss? says Peeta wryly. Iwas going to ask your thoughts on the war, but if youre too upset... begins Caesar. Oh, Im not too upset to answer that. Peeta takes a deep breath and then looks straight into the camera. I want everyone watching- whether youre on the Capitol or the rebel side- to stop for just a moment and think about what this war could mean. For human beings. We almost went extinct fighting one another before. Now our numbers are even fewer. Our conditions more tenuous.'

const midq = 'Is this really what we want to do? Kill ourselves off completely? In the hopes that- what? Some decent species will inherit the smoking remains of the earth? I dont really...Im not sure Im following... says Caesar. We cant fight one another, Caesar, Peeta explains. There wont be enough of us left to keep going. If everybody doesnt lay down their weapons- and Imean, as in very soon- its all over, anyway. So...youre calling for a cease-fire? Caesar asks. Yes. Im calling for a cease-fire, says Peeta tiredly. Now why dont we ask the guards to take me back to my quarters so I can build another hundred card houses? Caesar turns to the camera. All right. I think that wraps it up. So back to our regularly scheduled programming. Music plays them out, and then theres a woman reading a list of expected shortages in the Capitol- fresh fruit, solar batteries, soap. Iwatch her with uncharacteristic absorption, because I know everyone will be waiting for my reaction to the interview. But theres no way I can process it all so quickly- the joy of seeing Peeta alive and unharmed, his defense of my innocence in collaborating with the rebels, and his undeniable complicity with the Capitol now that hes called for a cease-fire. Oh, he made it sound as if he were condemning both sides in the war. But at this point, with only minor victories for the rebels, a cease-fire could only result in a return to our previous status. Or worse. Behind me, I can hear the accusations against Peeta building. The words traitor, liar, and enemy bounce off the walls. Since I can neither join in the rebels outrage nor counter it, I decide the best thing to do is clear out. As Ireach the door, Coins voice rises above the others. You have not been dismissed, Soldier Everdeen. One of Coins men lays a hand on my arm. Its not an aggressive move, really, but after the arena, Ireact defensively to any unfamiliar touch. I jerk my arm free and take off running down the halls. Behind me, theres the sound of a scuffle, but I dont stop. My mind does a quick inventory of my odd little hiding places, and Iwind up in the supply closet, curled up against a crate of chalk. Youre alive, Iwhisper, pressing my palms against my cheeks, feeling the smile thats so wide it must look like a grimace. Peetas alive.And a traitor. But at the moment, I dont care. Not what he says, or who he says it for, only that he is still capable of speech. After a while, the door opens and someone slips in. Gale slides down beside me, his nose trickling blood. What happened? I ask. I got in Boggss way, he answers with a shrug. I use my sleeve to wipe his nose. Watch it I try to be gentler. Patting, not wiping. Which one is he? Oh, you know. Coins right-hand lackey. The one who tried to stop you. He pushes my hand away. Quit Youll bleed me to death. The trickle has turned to a steady stream. I give up on the first-aid attempts. You fought with Boggs? No, just blocked the doorway when he tried to follow you. His elbow caught me in the nose, says Gale. Theyll probably punish you, I say. Already have. He holds up his wrist. I stare at it uncomprehendingly. Coin took back my communicuff. I bite my lip, trying to remain serious. But it seems so ridiculous. Im sorry, Soldier Gale Hawthorne. Dont be, Soldier Katniss Everdeen. He grins. I felt like a jerk walking around with it anyway. We both start laughing. I think it was quite a demotion. This is one of the few good things about 13. Getting Gale back. With the pressure of the Capitols arranged marriage between Peeta and me gone, weve managed to regain our friendship. He doesnt push it any furthertry to kiss me or talk about love. Either Ive been too sick, or hes willing to give me space, or he knows its just too cruel with Peeta in the hands of the Capitol. Whatever the case, Ive got someone to tell my secrets to again. Who are these people? I say. Theyre us. If wed had nukes instead of a few lumps of coal, he answers. I like to think Twelve wouldnt have abandoned the rest of the rebels back in the Dark Days, I say. We might have. If it was that, surrender, or start a nuclear war, says Gale. In a way, its remarkable they survived at all. Maybe its because I still have the ashes of my own district on my shoes, but for the first time, I give the people of 13 something I have withheld from them: credit. For staying alive against all odds. Their early years must have been terrible, huddled in the chambers beneath the ground after their city was bombed to dust. Population decimated, no possible ally to turn to for aid. Over the past seventy-five years, theyve learned to be self-sufficient, turned their citizens into an army, and built a new society with no help from anyone. They would be even more powerful if that pox epidemic hadnt flattened their birthrate and made them so desperate for a new gene pool and breeders. Maybe they are militaristic, overly programmed, and somewhat lacking in a sense of humor. Theyre here.And willing to take on the Capitol. Still, it took them long enough to show up'

const midr = 'I say. It wasnt simple. They had to build up a rebel base in the Capitol, get some sort of underground organized in the districts, he says. Then they needed someone to set the whole thing in motion. They needed you. They needed Peeta, too, but they seem to have forgotten that, I say. Gales expression darkens. Peeta might have done a lot of damage tonight. Most of the rebels will dismiss what he said immediately, of course. But there are districts where the resistance is shakier. The ceasefires clearly President Snows idea. But it seems so reasonable coming out of Peetas mouth. Im afraid of Gales answer, but I ask anyway. Why do you think he said it? He might have been tortured. Or persuaded. My guess is he made some kind of deal to protect you. Hed put forth the idea of the cease-fire if Snow let him present you as a confused pregnant girl who had no idea what was going on when she was taken prisoner by the rebels. This way, if the districts lose, theres still a chance of leniency for you. If you play it right. Imust still look perplexed because Gale delivers the next line very slowly. Katniss...hes still trying to keep you alive. To keep me alive?And then I understand. The Games are still on. We have left the arena, but since Peeta and Iwerent killed, his last wish to preserve my life still stands. His idea is to have me lie low, remain safe and imprisoned, while the war plays out. Then neither side will really have cause to kill me.And Peeta? If the rebels win, it will be disastrous for him. If the Capitol wins, who knows? Maybe well both be allowed to live- if I play it right- to watch the Games go on.... Images flash through my mind: the spear piercing Rues body in the arena, Gale hanging senseless from the whipping post, the corpse-littered wasteland of my home.And for what? For what? As my blood turns hot, I remember other things. My first glimpse of an uprising in District 8. The victors locked hand in hand the night before the Quarter Quell.And how it was no accident, my shooting that arrow into the force field in the arena. How badly Iwanted it to lodge deep in the heart of my enemy. I spring up, upsetting a box of a hundred pencils, sending them scattering around the floor. What is it? Gale asks. There cant be a cease-fire. I lean down, fumbling as I shove the sticks of dark gray graphite back into the box. We cant go back. I know. Gale sweeps up a handful of pencils and taps them on the floor into perfect alignment. Whatever reason Peeta had for saying those things, hes wrong. The stupid sticks wont go in the box and I snap several in my frustration. I know. Give it here. Youre breaking them to bits. He pulls the box from my hands and refills it with swift, concise motions. He doesnt know what they did to Twelve. If he couldve seen what was on the ground-  I start. Katniss, Im not arguing. If I could hit a button and kill every living soul working for the Capitol, Iwould do it. Without hesitation. He slides the last pencil into the box and flips the lid closed. The question is, what are you going to do? It turns out the question thats been eating away at me has only ever had one possible answer. But it took Peetas ploy for me to recognize it. What am I going to do? I take a deep breath. My arms rise slightly- as if recalling the black-and-white wings Cinna gave me- then come to rest at my sides. Im going to be the Mockingjay.They walked through the building, stopping here and there for Coach Hedge to lecture them with his megaphone, which alternately made him sound like a Sith Lord or blared out random comments like The pig says oink. Leo kept pulling out nuts, bolts, and pipe cleaners from the pockets of his army jacket and putting them together, like he had to keep his hands busy at all times. Jason was too distracted to pay much attention to the exhibits, but they were about the Grand Canyon and the Hualapai tribe, which owned the museum. Some girls kept looking over at Piper and Dylan and snickering. Jason figured these girls were the popular clique. They wore matching jeans and pink tops and enough makeup for a Halloween party. One of them said, Hey, Piper, does your tribe run this place? Do you get in free if you do a rain dance? The other girls laughed. Even Pipers so-called partner Dylan suppressed a smile. Pipers snowboarding jacket sleeves hid her hands, but Jason got the feeling she was clenching her fists. My dads Cherokee, she said. Not Hualapai. Course, youd need a few brain cells to know the difference, Isabel. Isabel widened her eyes in mock surprise, so that she looked like an owl with a makeup addiction. Oh, sorry Was your mom in this tribe? Oh, thats right. You never knew your mom. Piper charged her, but before a fight could start, Coach Hedge barked, Enough back there Set a good example or Ill break out my baseball bat The group shuffled on to the next exhibit, but the girls kept calling out little comments to Piper. Good to be back on the rez? one asked in a sweet voice. Dads probably too drunk to work, another said with fake sympathy. Thats why she turned klepto. Piper ignored them, but Jason was ready to punch them himself. He might not remember Piper, or even who he was, but he knew he hated mean kids. Leo caught his arm. Be cool. Piper doesnt like us fighting her battles. Besides, if those girls found out the truth about her dad, theyd be all bowing down to her and screaming, Were not worthy Why? What about her dad? Leo laughed in disbelief. Youre not kidding? You really dont remember that your girlfriends dad— Look, Iwish I did, but I dont even remember her, much less her dad. Leo whistled. Whatever. We have to talk when we get back to the dorm. They reached the far end of the exhibit hall, where some big glass doors led out to a terrace. All right, cupcakes, Coach Hedge announced. You are about to see the Grand Canyon. Try not to break it. The skywalk can hold the weight of seventy jumbo jets, so you featherweights should be safe out there. If possible, try to avoid pushing each other over the edge, as that would cause me extra paperwork. The coach opened the doors, and they all stepped outside. The Grand Canyon spread before them, live and in person. Extending over the edge was a horseshoe-shaped walkway made of glass, so you could see right through it. Man, Leo said. Thats pretty wicked. Jason had to agree. Despite his amnesia and his feeling that he didnt belong there, he couldnt help being impressed. The canyon was bigger and wider than you could appreciate from a picture. They were up so high that birds circled below their feet. Five hundred feet down, a river snaked along the canyon floor. Banks of storm clouds had moved overhead while theyd been inside, casting shadows like angry faces across the cliffs.As far as Jason could see in any direction, red and gray ravines cut through the desert like some crazy god had taken a knife to it. Jason got a piercing pain behind his eyes. Crazy gods ... Where had he come up with that idea? He felt like hed gotten close to something important—something he should know about. He also got the unmistakable feeling he was in danger. You all right? Leo asked. Youre not going to throw up over the side, are you? Cause I shouldve brought my camera. Jason grabbed the railing. He was shivering and sweaty, but it had nothing to do with heights. He blinked, and the pain behind his eyes subsided. Im fine, he managed. Just a headache. Thunder rumbled overhead.A cold wind almost knocked him sideways. This cant be safe. Leo squinted at the clouds. Storms right over us, but its clear all the way around. Weird, huh? Jason looked up and saw Leo was right. A dark circle of clouds had parked itself over the skywalk, but the rest of the sky in every direction was perfectly clear. Jason had a bad feeling about that. All right, cupcakes Coach Hedge yelled. He frowned at the storm like it bothered him too. We may have to cut this short, so get to work Remember, complete sentences The storm rumbled, and Jasons head began to hurt again. Not knowing why he did it, he reached into his jeans pocket and brought out a coin—a circle of gold the size of a half-dollar'

const mids = 'but thicker and more uneven. Stamped on one side was a picture of a battle-ax. On the other was some guys face wreathed in laurels. The inscription said something like ivlivs. Dang, is that gold? Leo asked. You been holding out on me Jason put the coin away, wondering how hed come to have it, and why he had the feeling he was going to need it soon. Its nothing, he said. Just a coin. Leo shrugged. Maybe his mind had to keep moving as much as his hands. Come on, he said. Dare you to spit over the edge. They didnt try very hard on the worksheet. For one thing, Jason was too distracted by the storm and his own mixed-up feelings. For another thing, he didnt have any idea how to name three sedimentary strata you observe or describe two examples of erosion. Leo was no help. He was too busy building a helicopter out of pipe cleaners. Check it out. He launched the copter. Jason figured it would plummet, but the pipe-cleaner blades actually spun. The little copter made it halfway across the canyon before it lost momentum and spiraled into the void. Howd you do that? Jason asked. Leo shrugged. Wouldve been cooler if I had some rubber bands. Seriously, Jason said, are we friends? Last I checked. You sure? What was the first day we met? What did we talk about? It was Leo frowned. I dont recall exactly. Im ADHD, man. You cant expect me to remember details. But I dont remember you at all. I dont remember anyone here. What if— Youre right and everyone else is wrong? Leo asked. You think you just appeared here this morning, and weve all got fake memories of you? A little voice in Jasons head said, Thats exactly what I think. But it sounded crazy. Everybody here took him for granted. Everyone acted like he was a normal part of the class—except for Coach Hedge. Take the worksheet. Jason handed Leo the paper. Ill be right back. Before Leo could protest, Jason headed across the skywalk. Their school group had the place to themselves. Maybe it was too early in the day for tourists, or maybe the weird weather had scared them off. The Wilderness School kids had spread out in pairs across the skywalk. Most were joking around or talking. Some of the guys were dropping pennies over the side. About fifty feet away, Piper was trying to fill out her worksheet, but her stupid partner Dylan was hitting on her, putting his hand on her shoulder and giving her that blinding white smile. She kept pushing him away, and when she saw Jason she gave him a look like, Throttle this guy for me. Jason motioned for her to hang on. He walked up to Coach Hedge, who was leaning on his baseball bat, studying the storm clouds. Did you do this? the coach asked him. Jason took a step back. Do what? It sounded like the coach had just asked if hed made the thunderstorm. Coach Hedge glared at him, his beady little eyes glinting under the brim of his cap. Dont play games with me, kid. What are you doing here, and why are you messing up my job? You mean...you dont know me? Jason said. Im not one of your students? Hedge snorted. Never seen you before today. Jason was so relieved he almost wanted to cry. At least he wasnt going insane. He was in the wrong place. Look, sir, I dont know how I got here. I just woke up on the school bus.All I know is Im not supposed to be here. Got that right. Hedges gruff voice dropped to a murmur, like he was sharing a secret. You got a powerful way with the Mist, kid, if you can make all these people think they know you; but you cant fool me. Ive been smelling monster for days now. I knew we had an infiltrator, but you dont smell like a monster. You smell like a half-blood. So—who are you, and whered you come from? Most of what the coach said didnt make sense, but Jason decided to answer honestly. I dont know who I am. I dont have any memories. Youve got to help me. Coach Hedge studied his face like was trying to read Jasons thoughts. Great, Hedge muttered. Youre being truthful. Of course I am And what was all that about monsters and half-bloods? Are those code words or something? Hedge narrowed his eyes. Part of Jason wondered if the guy was just nuts. But the other part knew better. Look, kid, Hedge said, I dont know who you are. I just know what you are, and it means trouble. Now I got to protect three of you rather than two. Are you the special package? Is that it? What are you talking about? Hedge looked at the storm. The clouds were getting thicker and darker, hovering right over the skywalk. This morning, Hedge said, I got a message from camp. They said an extraction team is on the way. Theyre coming to pick up a special package, but they wouldnt give me details. I thought to myself, Fine. The two Im watching are pretty powerful, older than most. I know theyre being stalked. I can smell a monster in the group. I figure thats why the camp is suddenly frantic to pick them up. But then you pop up out of nowhere. So, are you the special package? The pain behind Jasons eyes got worse than ever. Half-bloods. Camp. Monsters. He still didnt know what Hedge was talking about, but the words gave him a massive brain freeze—like his mind was trying to access information that shouldve been there but wasnt. He stumbled, and Coach Hedge caught him. For a short guy, the coach had hands like steel. Whoa, there, cupcake. You say you got no memories, huh? Fine. Ill just have to watch you, too, until the team gets here. Well let the director figure things out. What director? Jason said. What camp? Just sit tight. Reinforcements should be here soon. Hopefully nothing happens before— Lightning crackled overhead. The wind picked up with a vengeance. Worksheets flew into the Grand Canyon, and the entire bridge shuddered. Kids screamed, stumbling and grabbing the rails. I had to say something, Hedge grumbled. He bellowed into his megaphone: Everyone inside The cow says moo Off the skywalk I thought you said this thing was stable Jason shouted over the wind. Under normal circumstances, Hedge agreed, which these arent. Come on THESTORMCHURNEDINTOAMINIATUREHURRICANE. Funnel clouds snaked toward the skywalk like the tendrils of a monster jellyfish. Kids screamed and ran for the building. The wind snatched away their notebooks, jackets, hats, and backpacks. Jason skidded across the slick floor. Leo lost his balance and almost toppled over the railing, but Jason grabbed his jacket and pulled him back. Thanks, man Leo yelled. Go, go, go said Coach Hedge. Piper and Dylan were holding the doors open, herding the other kids inside. Pipers snowboarding jacket was flapping wildly, her dark hair all in her face. Jason thought she mustve been freezing, but she looked calm and confident—telling the others it would be okay, encouraging them to keep moving. Jason, Leo, and Coach Hedge ran toward them, but it was like running through quicksand. The wind seemed to fight them, pushing them back. Dylan and Piper pushed one more kid inside, then lost their grip on the doors. They slammed shut, closing off the skywalk. Piper tugged at the handles. Inside, the kids pounded on the glass, but the doors seemed to be stuck. Dylan, help Piper shouted. Dylan just stood there with an idiotic grin, his Cowboys jersey rippling in the wind, like he was suddenly enjoying the storm. Sorry, Piper, he said. Im done helping. He flicked his wrist, and Piper flew backward, slamming into the doors and sliding to the skywalk deck. Piper Jason tried to charge forward, but the wind was against him, and Coach Hedge pushed him back. Coach, Jason said, let me go Jason, Leo, stay behind me, the coach ordered. This is my fight. I shouldve known that was our monster. What? Leo demanded.A rogue worksheet slapped him in the face, but he swatted it away. What monster? The coachs cap blew off, and sticking up above his curly hair were two bumps—like the knots cartoon characters get when theyre bonked on the head. Coach Hedge lifted his baseball bat—but it wasnt a regular bat anymore. Somehow it had changed into a crudely shaped tree-branch club, with twigs and leaves still attached. Dylan gave him that psycho happy smile. Oh, come on, Coach. Let the boy attack me After all, youre getting too old for this. Isnt that why they retired you to this stupid school? Ive been on your team the entire season, and you didnt even know. Youre losing your nose, grandpa.'

const midt = 'The coach made an angry sound like an animal bleating. Thats it, cupcake. Youre going down. You think you can protect three half-bloods at once, old man? Dylan laughed. Good luck. Dylan pointed at Leo, and a funnel cloud materialized around him. Leo flew off the skywalk like hed been tossed. Somehow he managed to twist in midair, and slammed sideways into the canyon wall. He skidded, clawing furiously for any handhold. Finally he grabbed a thin ledge about fifty feet below the skywalk and hung there by his fingertips. Help he yelled up at them. Rope, please? Bungee cord? Something? Coach Hedge cursed and tossed Jason his club. I dont know who you are, kid, but I hope youre good. Keep that thing busy—he stabbed a thumb at Dylan—while I get Leo. Get him how? Jason demanded. You going to fly? Not fly. Climb. Hedge kicked off his shoes, and Jason almost had a coronary. The coach didnt have any feet. He had hooves—goats hooves. Which meant those things on his head, Jason realized, werent bumps. They were horns. Youre a faun, Jason said. Satyr Hedge snapped. Fauns are Roman. But well talk about that later. Hedge leaped over the railing. He sailed toward the canyon wall and hit hooves first. He bounded down the cliff with impossible agility, finding footholds no bigger than postage stamps, dodging whirlwinds that tried to attack him as he picked his way toward Leo. Isnt that cute Dylan turned toward Jason. Now its your turn, boy. Jason threw the club. It seemed useless with the winds so strong, but the club flew right at Dylan, even curving when he tried to dodge, and smacked him on the head so hard he fell to his knees. Piper wasnt as dazed as she appeared. Her fingers closed around the club when it rolled next to her, but before she could use it, Dylan rose. Blood —golden blood—trickled from his forehead. Nice try, boy. He glared at Jason. But youll have to do better. The skywalk shuddered. Hairline fractures appeared in the glass. Inside the museum, kids stopped banging on the doors. They backed away, watching in terror. Dylans body dissolved into smoke, as if his molecules were coming unglued. He had the same face, the same brilliant white smile, but his whole form was suddenly composed of swirling black vapor, his eyes like electrical sparks in a living storm cloud. He sprouted black smoky wings and rose above the skywalk. If angels could be evil, Jason decided, they would look exactly like this. Youre a ventus, Jason said, though he had no idea how he knew that word. A storm spirit. It feels as honest as the day is crummy that I begin this tale of total desperation and woe with me, my pukey sister, Georgia, and Leonardo the Silent sitting like rotting sardines in the back of a Hills Village Police Department cruiser. Now, theres a pathetic family portrait you dont want to be a part of, believe me. More on the unfortunate Village Police incident later. I need to work myself up to tell you that disaster story. So anyway, ta-da, here it is, book fans, and all of you in need of AR points at school, the true autobio of my life so far. The dreaded middle school years. If youve ever been a middle schooler, you understand already. If youre not in middle school yet, youll understand soon enough. But lets face it: Understanding me—I mean, really understanding me and my nutty life—isnt so easy. Thats why its so hard for me to find people I can trust. The truth is, I dont know who I can trust. So mostly I dont trust anybody. Except my mom, Jules. (Most of the time, anyway.) So . . . lets see if I can trust you. First, some background. Thats me, by the way, arriving at prison—also known as Hills Village Middle School—in Juless SUV. The picture credit goes to Leonardo the Silent. Getting back to the story, though, I do trust one other person. That would actually be Leonardo. 2 Leo is capital C Crazy, and capital O Off-the-Wall, but he keeps things real. Here are some other people I dont trust as far as I can throw a truckload of pianos.'

const midu = 'Theres Ms. Ruthless Donatello, but you can just call her the Dragon Lady. She teaches English and also handles my favorite subject in sixth grade—after-school detention.  Also, Mrs. Ida Stricker, the vice principal. Idas pretty much in charge of every breath anybody takes at HVMS. Thats Georgia, my supernosy, super-obnoxious, super-brat sister, whose only good quality is that she looks like Jules might have looked when she was in fourth grade. There are more on my list, and well get to them eventually. Or maybe not. Im not exactly sure how this is going to work out. As you can probably tell, this is my first full-length book. But lets stay on the subject of us for a little bit. I kind of want to, but how do I know I can trust 5 \you with all my embarrassing personal stuff —like the police car disaster story? What are you like? Inside, what are you like? Are you basically a pretty good, pretty decent person? Says who? Says you? Says your rents? Says your sibs? Okay, in the spirit of a possible friendship between us—and this is a huge big deal for me— heres another true confession. This is what I actually looked like when I got to school that first morning of sixth grade. We still friends, or are you out of here? Hey —dont go— all right? I kind of like you. Seriously. You know how to listen, at least. And believe me, Ive got quite the story to tell you. Chapter 2 THE MIDDLE SCHOOL/ MAX SECURITY PRISON Okay, so imagine the day your great-great-grandmother was born. Got it? Now go back another hundred years or so. And then another hundred. Thats about when they built Hills Village Middle School. Of course, I think it was a prison for Pilgrims back then, but not too much has changed. Now its a prison for sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. Ive seen enough movies that I know when you first get to prison, you basically have two choices: (1) pound the living daylights out of someone so that everyone else will think youre insane and stay out of your way, or (2) keep your head down, try to blend in, and dont get on anyones bad side. Youve already seen what I look like, so you can probably guess which one I chose. As soon as I got to homeroom, I went straight for the back row and sat as far from the teachers desk as possible. There was just one problem with that plan, and his name was Miller. Miller the Killer, to be exact. Its impossible to stay off this kids bad side, because its the only one hes got. But I didnt know any of that yet. Sitting in the back, huh? he said. Yeah, I told him. Are you one of those troublemakers or something? he said. I just shrugged. I dont know. Not really. Cause this is where all the juvies sit, he said, and took a step closer. In fact, youre in my seat. I dont see your name on it, I told him, and I was just starting to think maybe that was the 8 wrong thing to say when Miller put one of his XXXL paws around my neck and started lifting me like a hundred-pound dumbbell. I usually like to keep my head attached to my body, so I went ahead and stood up like he wanted me to. Lets try that again, he said. This is my seat. Understand? I understood, all right. Id been in sixth grade for about four and a half minutes, and I already had a fluorescent orange target on my back. So much for blending in. And dont get me wrong. Im not a total wimp. Give me a few more chapters, and Ill show you what Im capable of. In the meantime, though, I decided to move to some other part of the room. Like maybe somewhere a little less hazardous to my health. But then, when I went to sit down again, Miller called over. Uh-uh, he said. That ones mine too. Can you see where this is going? By the time our homeroom teacher, Mr. Rourke, rolled in, I was just standing there wondering what it might be like to spend the next nine months without sitting down. Rourke looked over the top of his glasses at me. Excuse me, Mr.Khatch . . . Khatch-a . . . Khatch-ador— 10 Khatchadorian, I told him. Gesundheit someone shouted, and the entire class started laughing. Quiet Mr. Rourke snapped as he checked his attendance book for my name. And how are you today, Rafe? he said, smiling like there were cookies on the way. Fine, thanks, I answered. Do you find our seating uncomfortable? he asked me. Not exactly, I said, because I couldnt really go into details. Then SIT. DOWN. NOW Unlike Miller the Killer, Mr. Rourke definitely has two sides, and Id already met both of them. Since nobody else was stupid enough to sit right in front of Miller, that was the only seat left in the room. And because Im the worlds biggest idiot sometimes, I didnt look back when I went to sit in my chair. Which is why I hit the dirt as I went down— all the way down— to the floor. The good news? Given the way things had started off, I figured middle school could only get better from here. The bad news? I was wrong about the good news. 12 Chapter 3 AT LEAST IVE GOT LEO Do you remember that nursery rhyme about Jack Sprat and his wife? How neither of them ate the same thing, but between the two of them they got the job done? Same deal with me and Leo, except the fat and the lean are words and pictures. Make sense? I do the talking, and Leo takes care of the drawing. Leo speaks to me sometimes, but thats about it. Conversation just isnt his thing. If Leo wanted to tell you your house was on fire, hed probably draw you a picture to let you know. The guy is about as talkative as a giraffe. (Oh, Ive got a thousand of them, ladies and gentlemen.) Say hi, Leo. See what I mean? Besides, if its true that a pictures worth a thousand words, then my buddy Leo has more to say than anyone Ive ever met. You just have to know how to listen. Bottom line, Leonardo the Silent is my best friend, at Hills Village or anywhere else. And before his head gets too big to fit through the door, I should say theres not a whole lot of competition for that title. Im not exactly what you might see in the dictionary when you look up popular. Which brings me to the next thing that happened that day. 15 Chapter 4 RAH, RAH, RAH, YADA, YADA, YADA . . . After homeroom theyd usually ship us off to first period, but today was special. There was going to be a Big School Assembly to kick off the year, and everyone was all excited about it. Of course, by everyone, I mean everyone but me. They herded us all into the gym and sat us down on the bleachers. There was a podium on the floor with a microphone, and a big sign on the wall: w and screaming. (Of course, by everyone, I mean everyone but me.) The only things missing were the circus tent and a couple of dancing elephants. After that part, Mrs. Stricker announced that anyone who wanted to run for student council representative should come down to the microphone and address the assembly. Five or six kids from every grade stood up, like theyd been expecting this. I guess Mr. Rourke might have said something about it in homeroom, but Id been too busy waiting for Miller to drive a pencil through the back of my neck. I hadnt paid attention to too much else. They started with the sixth graders first. We heard from two bozos who I didnt know, then a guy named Matt Kruschik who ate his own boogers until fourth grade, and then— Hi, everyone. Im Jeanne Galletta. About half of the sixth grade and even some of the seventh and eighth graders started clapping right away. She must have gone to Millbrook Elementary, because Id never seen her before. I went to Seagrave Elementary, where we chased rats in gym class, and most of the kids got free lunch, including me. I think Id be a good class representative because I know how to listen, Jeanne said. And   2:20:04AM theres nothing more important than that. I was listening, I was listening. She was pretty, for sure. She had the kind of face that you just want to stare at for as long as possible. But she also seemed kind of cool, like she didnt think she was better than anyone else. Even if she was. I have a lot of good ideas for how to make the school a better place, she goes on. But first, I want to do one thing. She leaves the mike and comes over, right in front of where Im sitting. Then she looks straight at me and says, Are you Rafe? Suddenly, Im feeling about as talkative as Leo, but I manage to spit out an answer. Thats me, I say. Do you want to maybe split a large fries in the cafeteria later? she asks. Sure. Im buying, I say, because theres a twenty-dollar bill in my pocket that I just found that morning. No, she says.'

const midv = 'The fries are on me. Meanwhile, everyones watching. The band starts playing, the cheerleaders start cheering, 21 and Miller the Killer chokes to death on a peanut M&M. Then I win the lottery, world peace breaks out everywhere, and Mrs. Stricker tells me that based on my all-around awesomeness, I can just skip sixth grade and come back next year. . . . so I hope youll vote for me, Jeanne was saying, and everyone started clapping like crazy. I never even heard most of her speech. But she definitely had my vote. 2Chapter 5 THOSE OH-SO-CRUEL RULES The next girl to speak at assembly was Lexi Winchester. I knew Lexi from my old school, and she was a real nice kid. Still, Jeanne Galletta had my vote. Sorry, Lex. Once the speeches were over, I thought the assembly was done too. No such luck. Mrs. Stricker came back to the microphone and held up a little green book so everyone could see it. Can anyone tell me what this is? Stricker said. Yeah, Miller the Killer mumbled somewhere behind me. A complete waste of time. This, Mrs. Stricker said, is the Hills Village Middle School Code of Conduct. Everything you need to know about how to behave at school—and how not to behave—is right here in this book. A bunch of teachers came around and started handing out a copy to each student in the gym. When you receive yours, open up to page one and follow along with me, Stricker said. Then she started reading . . . really . . . slowly.  Section One: Hills Village Middle School Dress Code . . . When I got my copy, I flipped all the way to the back of the book. There were sixteen sections and twenty-six pages total. In other words, we were going to be lucky to get out of this assembly by Christmas. . . . All students are expected to dress appropriately for an academic environment. No student shall wear clothing of a size more than two beyond his or her normal size. . . . HELP Thats what I was thinking about then. Middle school had just started, and they were already trying to bore us to death. Please, somebody stop Mrs. Stricker before she kills again Leo took out a pen and started drawing something on the inside of the back cover. Stricker turned to the next page and kept reading. 25Section Two: Prohibited Items. No student shall bring to school any electronic equipment not intended for class purposes. This includes cell phones, iPods, cameras, laptop computers. . . . The whole thing went on and on. And on. And on. By the time we got to Section 6 (Grounds for Expulsion), my brain was turning into guacamole, and Im pretty sure my ears were bleeding too. People always talk about how great it is to get older. All I saw were more rules and more adults telling me what I could and couldnt do, in the name of whats good for me. Yeah, well, asparagus is good for me, but it still makes me want to throw up. As far as I could tell, this little green book in my hands was just one long list of all the ways I could—and probably would—get into trouble between now and the end of the school year. Meanwhile, Leo was drawing away like the maniac he is. Every time Stricker mentioned another rule, he scribbled something else on the page in front of him. Finally, he turned it around and showed me what he was working on. In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraith-like shadows that raced along the ground. The house shook. Wrapped in her quilt, Meg shook. She wasnt usually afraid of weather. —Its not just the weather, she thought. —Its the weather on top of everything else. On top of me. On top of Meg Murry doing everything wrong. School. School was all wrong. Shed been dropped down to the lowest section in her grade. That morning one of her teachers had said crossly, Really, Meg, I dont understand how a child with parents as brilliant as yours are supposed to be can be such a poor student. If you dont manage to do a little better youll have to stay back next year. During lunch shed rough-housed a little to try to make herself feel better, and one of the girls said scornfully, After all, Meg, we arent grammar-school kids any more. Why do you always act like such a baby? And on the way home from school, walking up the road with her arms full of books, one of the boys had said something about her dumb baby brother. At this shed thrown die books on the side of the road and tackled him with every ounce of strength she had, and arrived home with her blouse torn and a big bruise under one eye.'

const midw = 'Sandy and Dennys, her ten-year-old twin brothers, who got home from school an hour earlier than she did, were disgusted. Let us do the fighting when its necessary, they told her. 1 —A delinquent, thats what I am, she thought grimly. —Thats what theyll be saying next. Not Mother. But Them. Everybody Else. I wish Father— But it was still not possible to think about her father without the danger of tears. Only her mother could talk about him in a natural way, saying, When your father gets back— Gets back from where? And when? Surely her mother must know what people were saying, must be aware of the smugly vicious gossip. Surely it must hurt her as it did Meg. But if it did she gave no outward sign. Nothing ruffled the serenity other expression. —Why cant I hide it, too? Meg thought. Why do I always have to show everything? The window rattled madly in the wind, and she pulled the quilt dose about her. Curled up on one of her pillows a gray fluff of kitten yawned, showing its pink tongue, tucked its head under again, and went back to sleep. Everybody was asleep. Everybody except Meg. Even Charles Wallace, the dumb baby brother, who had an uncanny way of knowing when she was awake and unhappy, and who would come, so many nights, tiptoeing up the attic stairs to her—even Charles Wallace was asleep. How could they sleep? All day on the radio there had been hurricane warnings. How could they leave her up in the attic in the rickety brass bed, knowing that the roof might be blown right off the house, and she tossed out into the wild night sky to land who knows where? Her shivering grew uncontrollable. —You asked to have the attic bedroom, she told herself savagely. —Mother let you have it because youre the oldest. Ifs a privilege, not a punishment. Not during a hurricane, it isnt a privilege, she said aloud. She tossed the quilt down on the foot of the bed, and stood up. The kitten stretched luxuriously, and looked up at her with huge, innocent eyes. Go back to sleep, Meg said. Just be glad youre a kitten and not a monster like me. She looked at herself 2 in the wardrobe mirror and made a horrible face, baring a mouthful of teeth covered with braces. Automatically she pushed her glasses into position, ran her fingers through her mouse-brown hair, so that it stood wildly on end, and let out a sigh almost as noisy as the wind. The wide wooden floorboards were cold against her feet. Wind blew in the crevices about the window frame, in spite of the protection the storm sash was supposed to offer. She could hear wind howling in the chimneys. From all the way downstairs she could hear Fortinbras, the big black dog, starting to bark. He must be frightened, too. What was he barking at? Fortinbras never barked without reason. Suddenly she remembered that when she had gone to the post office to pick up the mail shed heard about a tramp who was supposed to have stolen twelve sheets from Mrs. Buncombe, the constables wife. They hadnt caught him, and maybe he was heading for the Murrys house right now, isolated on a back road as it was; and this time maybe hed be after more than sheets. Meg hadnt paid much attention to the talk about the tramp at the time, because the postmistress, with a sugary smile, had asked if shed heard from her father lately. She left her little room and made her way through the shadows of the main attic, bumping against the ping-pong table. —Now Ill have a bruise on my hip on top of everything else, she thought. Next she walked into her old dolls house, Charles Wallaces rocking horse, the twins electric trains. Why must everything happen to me? She demanded of a large teddy bear. At the foot of the attic stairs she stood still and listened. Not a sound from Charles Wallaces room on the right. On the left, in her parents room, not a rustle from her mother sleeping alone in the great double bed. She tiptoed down the hall and into the twins room, pushing again at her glasses as though they could help her to see better in the dark. Dennys was snoring. Sandy murmured something about baseball and subsided. The twins didnt have any problems. They werent great students, but they werent bad ones, either. They were perfectly content with a succession of Bs and an occasional A or C. They were strong and 3 fast runners and good at games, and when cracks were made about anybody in the Murry family, they werent made about Sandy and Dennys. She left the twins room and went on downstairs, avoiding the creaking seventh step. Fortinbras had stopped barking. It wasnt the tramp this time, then. Fort would go On barking if anybody was around. —But suppose the tramp does come? Suppose he has a knife? Nobody lives near enough to hear if we screamed and screamed and screamed. Nobodyd care, anyhow. —Ill make myself some cocoa, she decided. —Thatll cheer me up, and if the roof blows off at least I wont go off with it. In the kitchen a light was already on, and Charles Wallace was sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam. He looked very small and vulnerable sitting there alone in the big old-fashioned kitchen, a blond little boy in faded blue Dr. Dentons, his feet swinging a good six inches above the floor. Hi, he said cheerfully. Ive been waiting for you. From under the table where he was lying at Charles Wallaces feet, hoping for a crumb or two, Fortinbras raised his slender dark head in greeting to Meg, and his tail thumped against the floor. Fortinbras had arrived on their doorstep, a half-grown puppy, scrawny and abandoned, one winter night. He was, Megs father had decided'

const midx = 'part Llewellyn setter and part greyhound, and he had a slender dark beauty that was all his own. Why didnt you come up to the attic? Meg asked her brother, speaking as though he were at least her own age. Ive been scared stiff. Too windy up in that attic of yours, the little boy said. I knew youd be down. I put some milk on the stove for you. It ought to be hot by now. How did Charles Wallace always know about her? How could he always tell? He never knew — or seemed to care — what Dennys or Sandy were thinking. It was his mothers mind, and Megs, that he probed with frightening accuracy. Was it because people were a little afraid of him that they whispered about the Murrys youngest child, who was rumored to be not quite bright? Ive heard that clever 4 people often have subnormal children, Meg had once overheard. The two boys seem to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly arent all there. It was true that Charles Wallace seldom spoke when anybody was around, so that many people thought hed never learned to talk. And it was true that he hadnt talked at all until he was almost four. Meg would turn white with fury when people looked at him and clucked, shaking their heads sadly. Dont worry about Charles Wallace, Meg. her father had once told her. Meg remembered it very clearly because it was shortly before he went away. Theres nothing the matter with his mind. He just does things in his own way and in his own time. I dont want him to grow up to be dumb like me, Meg had said. Oh, my darling, youre not dumb, her father answered. Youre like Charles Wallace. Your development has to go at its own pace. It just doesnt happen to be the usual pace. How do you know Meg had demanded. How do you know Im not dumb? Isnt it just because you love me? I love you, but thats not what tells me. Mother and Ive given you a number of tests, you know. Yes, that was true. Meg had realized that some of the games her parents played with her were tests of some kind, and that there had been more for her and Charles Wallace than for the twins. IQ tests, you mean? Yes, some of them. Is my IQ okay? More than okay. What is it? That Im not going to tell you. But it assures me that both you and Charles Wallace will be able to do pretty 5 much whatever you like when you grow up to yourselves. You just wait till Charles Wallace starts to talk. Youll see. How right he had been about that, though he himself had left before Charles Wallace began to speak, suddenly, with none of the usual baby preliminaries, using entire sentences. How proud he would have been Youd better check the milk, Charles Wallace said to Meg now, his diction clearer and cleaner than that of most five-year-olds. You know you dont like it when it gets a skin on top. You put in more than twice enough milk. Meg peered into the saucepan. Charles Wallace nodded serenely. I thought Mother might like some. I might like what? a voice said, and there was their mother standing in the doorway. Cocoa, Charles Wallace said. Would you like a liverwurst-and-cream-cheese sandwich? Ill be happy to make you one. That would be lovely, Mrs. Murry said, but I can make it myself if youre busy. No trouble at all. Charles Wallace slid down from his chair and trotted over to the refrigerator, his pajamaed feet padding softly as a kittens. How about you, Meg? he asked. Sandwich? Yes, please, she said. But not liverwurst. Do we have any tomatoes? Charles Wallace peered into the crisper. One. All right if I use it on Meg, Mother? To what better use could it be put? Mrs Murry smiled. But not so loud, please, Charles. That is, unless you want the twins downstairs, too. Lets be exclusive, Charles Wallace said. Thats my'

const midy = 'I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with someone its kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. Im different that way. I mean, my secondoldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going-on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story or drawing a picture, so Im not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it. Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like hes never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six instead of fourteen. I love Soda more than Ive ever loved anyone, even Mom and Dad. Hes always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darrys hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darrys gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapopll never grow up at all. I dont know which ways the best. Ill find out one of these days. Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some company. Greasers cant walk alone too much or theyll get jumped,  4 or someone will come by and scream Greaser at them, which doesnt make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. Im not sure how you spell it, but its the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. Its like the term greaser, which is used to class all us boys on the East Side. Were poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon were wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I dont mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mom and Dad were killed in an auto wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and were careful not to get caught when we cant. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. Im not saying that either Socs orgreasers are better; thats just the way things are. I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just cant sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other peoples. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider family. Were almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews--- one of our gang--- would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just dont use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, cause Im supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and everything, but I dont use my head. Besides, I like walking.  5 I about decided I didnt like it so much, though, when I spotted that red Corvair trailing me. I was almost two blocks from home then, so I started walking a little faster. I had never been jumped, but I had seen Johnny after four Socs got hold of him, and it wasnt pretty. Johnny was scared of his own shadow after that. Johnny was sixteen then. I knew it wasnt any use though--- the fast walking, I mean--- even before the Corvair pulled up beside me and five Socs got out. I got pretty scared--- Im kind of small for fourteen even though I have a good build, and those guys were bigger than me. I automatically hitched my thumbs in my jeans and slouched, wondering if I could get away if I made a break for it. I remembered Johnny--- his face all cut up and bruised, and I remembered how he had cried when we found him, half-conscious, in the comer lot. Johnny had it awful rough at home--- it took a lot to make him cry. I was sweating something fierce, although I was cold. I could feel my palms getting clammy and the perspiration running down my back. I get like that when Im real scared. I glanced around for a pop bottle or a stick or something--- Steve Randle, Sodas best buddy, had once held off four guys with a busted pop bottle--- but there was nothing. So I stood there like a bump on a log while they surrounded me. I dont use my head. They walked around slowly, silently, smiling. Hey, grease, one said in an over-friendly voice. Were gonna do you a favor, greaser. Were gonna cut all that long greasy hair off. He had on a madras shirt. I can still see it. Blue madras. One of them laughed, then cussed me out in a low voice. I couldnt think of anything to say. There just isnt a whole lot you can say while waiting to get mugged, so I kept my mouth shut. Need a haircut, greaser? The medium-sized blond pulled a knife out of his back pocket and flipped the blade open. I finally thought of something to say. No. I was backing up, away from that knife. Of course I backed right into one of them. They had me down in a second. They had my arms and legs pinned down and one of them was sitting on my chest with his  6 knees on my elbows, and if you dont think that hurts, youre crazy. I could smell English Leather shaving lotion and stale tobacco, and I wondered foolishly if I would suffocate before they did anything. I was scared so bad I was wishing I would. I fought to get loose, and almost did for a second; then they tightened up on me and the one on my chest slugged me a couple of times. So I lay still, swearing at them between gasps. A blade was held against my throat. Howd you like that haircut to begin just below the chin? It occurred to me then that they could kill me. I went wild. I started screaming for Soda, Darry, anyone. Someone put his hand over my mouth, and I bit it as hard as I could, tasting the blood running through my teeth. I heard a muttered curse and got slugged again, and they were stuffing a handkerchief in my mouth. One of them kept saying, Shut him up, for Petes sake, shut him up Then there were shouts and the pounding of feet, and the Socs jumped up and left me lying there, gasping. I lay there and wondered what in the world was happening--- people were jumping over me and running by me and I was too dazed to figure it out. Then someone had me under the armpits and was hauling me to my feet. It was Darry. Are you all right, Ponyboy? He was shaking me and I wished hed stop. I was dizzy enough anyway. I could tell it was Darry though--- partly because of the voice and partly because Darrys always rough with me without meaning to be. Im okay. Quit shaking me, Darry, Im okay. He stopped instantly. Im sorry. He wasnt really. Darry isnt ever sorry for anything he does. It seems funny to me that he should look just exactly like my father and act exactly the opposite from him. My father was only forty when he died and he looked twenty-five and a lot of people thought  7 Darry and Dad were brothers instead of father and son. But they only looked alike--- my father was never rough with anyone without meaning to be. Darry is six-feet-two, and broad-shouldered and muscular. He has dark-brown hair that kicks out in front and a slight cowlick in the back--- just like Dads--- but Darrys eyes are his own. Hes got eyes that are like two pieces of pale blue-green ice.'

const midz = 'Theyve got a determined set to them, like the rest of him. He looks older than twenty--- tough, cool, and smart. He would be real handsome if his eyes werent so cold. He doesnt understand anything that is not plain hard fact. But he uses his head. I sat down again, rubbing my cheek where Id been slugged the most. Darry jammed his fists in his pockets. They didnt hurt you too bad, did they? They did. I was smarting and aching and my chest was sore and I was so nervous my hands were shaking and I wanted to start bawling, but you just dont say that to Darry. Im okay. Sodapop came loping back. By then I had figured that all the noise I had heard was the gang coming to rescue me. He dropped down beside me, examining my head. You got cut up a little, huh, Ponyboy? I only looked at him blankly. I did? He pulled out a handkerchief, wet the end of it with his tongue, and pressed it gently against the side of my head. Youre bleedin like a stuck pig. I am? Look He showed me the handkerchief, reddened as if by magic. Did they pull a blade on you?  8 I remembered the voice: Need a haircut, greaser? The blade must have slipped while he was trying to shut me up. Yeah. Soda is handsomer than anyone else I know. Not like Darry--- Sodas movie-star kind of handsome, the kind that people stop on the street to watch go by. Hes not as tall as Darry, and hes a little slimmer, but he has a finely drawn, sensitive face that somehow manages to be reckless and thoughtful at the same time. Hes got dark-gold hair that he combs back--- long and silky and straight--- and in the summer the sun bleaches it to a shining wheat gold. His eyes are dark brown--- lively, dancing, recklessly laughing eyes that can be gentle and sympathetic one moment and blazing with anger the next. He has Dads eyes, but Soda is one of a kind. He can get drunk in a drag race or dancing without ever getting near alcohol. In our neighborhood its rare to find a kid who doesnt drink once in a while. But Soda never touches a drop--- he doesnt need to. He gets drunk on just plain living. And he understands everybody. He looked at me more closely. I looked away hurriedly, because, if you want to know the truth, I was starting to bawl. I knew I was as white as I felt and I was shaking like a leaf. Soda just put his hand on my shoulder. Easy, Ponyboy. They aint gonna hurt you no more. I know, I said, but the ground began to blur and I felt hot tears running down my cheeks. I brushed them away impatiently. Im just a little spooked, thats all. I drew a quivering breath and quit crying. You just dont cry in front of Darry. Not unless youre hurt like Johnny had been that day we found him in the vacant lot. Compared to Johnny I wasnt hurt at all. Soda rubbed my hair. Youre an okay kid, Pony. I had to grin at him--- Soda can make you grin no matter what. I guess its because hes always grinning so much himself. Youre crazy, Soda, out of your mind.  9 Darry looked as if hed like to knock our heads together. Youre both nuts. Soda merely cocked one eyebrow, a trick hed picked up from Two-Bit. It seems to run in this family. Darry stared at him for a second, then cracked a grin. Sodapop isnt afraid of him like everyone else and enjoys teasing him. Id just as soon tease a full-grown grizzly; but for some reason, Darry seems to like being teased by Soda. Our gang had chased the Socs to their car and heaved rocks at them. They came running toward us now--- four lean, hard guys. They were all as tough as nails and looked it. l had grown up with them, and they accepted me, even though I was younger, because I was Darry and Sodas kid brother and I kept my mouth shut good. Steve Randle was seventeen, tall and lean, with thick greasy hair he kept combed in complicated swirls. He was tacky, smart, and Sodas best buddy since grade school. Steves specialty was cars. He could lift a hubcap quicker and more quietly than anyone in the neighborhood, but he also knew cars upside-down and backward, and he could drive anything on wheels. He and Soda worked at the same gas station--- Steve part time and Soda full time--- and their station got more customers than any other in town. Whether that was because Steve was so good with cars or because Soda attracted girls like honey draws flies, I couldnt tell you. I liked Steve only because he was Sodas best friend. He didnt like me--- he thought I was a tag-along and a kid; Soda always took me with them when they went places if they werent taking girls, and that bugged Steve. It wasnt my fault; Soda always asked me; I didnt ask him. Soda doesnt think Im a kid. Two-Bit Mathews was the oldest of the gang and the wisecracker of the bunch. He was about six feet tall, stocky in build, and very proud of his long rusty-colored sideburns. He had gray eyes and a wide grin, and he couldnt stop making funny remarks to save his life. You couldnt shut up that guy; he always had to get his two-bits worth in. Hence his name. Even his teachers forgot his real name was Keith, and we hardly remembered he had one. Life was one big joke to Two-Bit. He was famous for shoplifting and his black-handled switchblade (which he couldnt have acquired without  10 his first talent), and he was always smarting off to the cops. He really couldnt help it. Everything he said was so irresistibly funny that he just had to let the police in on it to brighten up their dull lives. (Thats the way he explained it to me.) He liked fights, blondes, and for some unfathomable reason, school. He was still a junior at eighteen and a half and he never learned anything. He just went for kicks. I liked him real well because he kept us laughing at ourselves as well as at other things. He reminded me of Will Rogers--- maybe it was the grin. If I had to pick the real character of the gang, it would be Dallas Winston--- Dally. I used to like to draw his picture when he was in a dangerous mood, for then I could get his personality down in a few lines. He had an elfish face, with high cheekbones and a pointed chin, small, sharp animal teeth, and ears like a lynx. His hair was almost white it was so blond, and he didnt like haircuts, or hair oil either, so it fell over his forehead in wisps and kicked out in the back in tufts and curled behind his ears and along the nape of his neck. His eyes were blue, blazing ice, cold with a hatred of the whole world. Dally had spent three years on the wild side of New York and had been arrested at the age of ten. He was tougher than the rest of us--- tougher, colder, meaner. The shade of difference that separates a greaser from a hood wasnt present in Dally. He was as wild as the boys in the downtown outfits, like Tim Shepards gang. In New York, Dally blew off steam in gang fights, but here, organized gangs are rarities--- there are just small bunches of friends who stick together, and the warfare is between the social classes. A rumble, when its called, is usually born of a grudge fight, and the opponents just happen to bring their friends along. Oh, there are a few named gangs around, like the River Kings and the Tiber Street Tigers, but here in the Southwest theres no gang rivalry. So Dally, even though he could get into a good fight sometimes, had no specific thing to hate. No rival gang. Only Socs. And you cant win against them no matter how hard you try, because theyve got all the breaks and even whipping them isnt going to change that fact. Maybe that was why Dallas was so bitter. He had quite a reputation. They have a file on him down at the police station. He had been arrested, he got drunk, he rode in rodeos, lied, cheated, stole, rolled drunks'

const midaa = 'jumped small kids--- he did everything. I didnt like him, but he was smart and you had to respect him. Johnny Cade was last and least. If you can picture a little dark puppy that has been kicked too many times and is lost in a crowd of strangers, youll have Johnny. He was the youngest, next to me, smaller than the rest, with a slight build. He had big black eyes in a dark tanned face; his hair was jet-black and heavily greased and combed to the side, but it was so long that it fell in shaggy bangs across his forehead. He had a nervous, suspicious look in his eyes, and that beating he got from the Socs didnt help matters. He was the gangs pet, everyones kid brother. His father was always beating him up, and his mother ignored him, except when she was hacked off at something, and then you could hear her yelling at him clear down at our house. I think he hated that worse than getting whipped. He would have run away a million times if we hadnt been there. If it hadnt been for the gang, Johnny would never have known what love and affection are. I wiped my eyes hurriedly. Didya catch em? Nup. They got away this time, the dirty... Two-Bit went on cheerfully, calling the Socs every name he could think of or make up. The kids okay? Im okay. I tried to think of something to say. Im usually pretty quiet arotmd people, even the gang. I changed the subject. I didnt know you were out of the cooler yet, Dally. Good behavior. Got off early. Dallas lit a cigarette and handed it to Johnny. Everyone sat down to have a smoke and relax. A smoke always lessens the tension. I had quit trembling and my color was back. The cigarette was calming me down. Two-Bit cocked an eyebrow. Nice-lookin bruise you got there, kid. I touched my cheek gingerly. Really? Two-Bit nodded sagely. Nice cut, too. Makes you look tough.  12 Tough and tuff are two different words. Tough is the same as rough; tuff means cool, sharp--- like a tuff-looking Mustang or a tuff record. In our neighborhood both are compliments. Steve flicked his ashes at me. What were you doin, walkin by your lonesome? Leave it to good old Steve to bring up something like that. I was comin home from the movies. I didnt think... You dont ever think, Darry broke in, not at home or anywhere when it counts. You must think at school, with all those good grades you bring home, and youve always got your nose in a book, but do you ever use your head for common sense? No sirree, bub. And if you did have to go by yourself, you should have carried a blade. I just stared at the hole in the toe of my tennis shoe. Me and Darry just didnt dig each other. I never could please him. He would have hollered at me for carrying a blade if I had carried one. If I brought home Bs, he wanted As, and if I got As, he wanted to make sure they stayed As. If I was playing football, I should be in studying, and if I was reading, I should be out playing football. He never hollered at Sodapop--- not even when Soda dropped out of school or got tickets for speeding. He just hollered at me.Prior to waking up, the book thief was dreaming about the Führer, Adolf Hitler. In the dream, she was attending a rally at which he spoke, looking at the skull-colored part in his hair and the perfect square of his mustache. She was listening contentedly to the torrent of words spilling from his mouth. His sentences glowed in the light. In a quieter moment, he actually crouched down and smiled at her. She returned the smile and said, Guten Tag, Herr Führer. Wie gehts dir heut? She hadnt learned to speak too well, or even to read, as she had rarely frequented school. The reason for that she would find out in due course. Just as the Führer was about to reply, she woke up. It was January 1939. She was nine years old, soon to be ten. Her brother was dead. One eye open. One still in a dream. It would be better for a complete dream, I think, but I really have no control over that. The second eye jumped awake and she caught me out, no doubt about it. It was exactly when I knelt down and extracted his soul, holding it limply in my swollen arms. He warmed up soon after, but when I picked him up originally, the boys spirit was soft and cold, like ice cream. He started melting in my arms. Then warming up completely. Healing. For Liesel Meminger, there was the imprisoned stiffness of movement and the staggered onslaught of thoughts. Es stimmt nicht. This isnt happening. This isnt happening. And the shaking. Why do they always shake them? Yes, I know, I know, I assume it has something to do with instinct. To stem the flow of truth. Her heart at that point was slippery and hot, and loud, so loud so loud. Stupidly, I stayed. I watched. Next, her mother. She woke her up with the same distraught shake. If you cant imagine it, think clumsy silence. Think bits and pieces of floating despair. And drowning in a train. Snow had been falling consistently, and the service to Munich was forced to stop due to faulty track work. There was a woman wailing. A girl stood numbly next to her. In panic, the mother opened the door. She climbed down into the snow, holding the small body. What could the girl do but follow? As youve been informed, two guards also exited the train. They discussed and argued over what to do. The situation was unsavory to say the least. It was eventually decided that all three of them should be taken to the next township and left there to sort things out. This time, the train limped through the snowed-in country. It hobbled in and stopped. They stepped onto the platform, the body in her mothers arms. They stood. The boy was getting heavy. Liesel had no idea where she was. All was white, and as they remained at the station, she could only stare at the faded lettering of the sign in front of her. For Liesel, the town was nameless, and it was there that her brother, Werner, was buried two days later. Witnesses included a priest and two shivering grave diggers. AN OBSERVATION A pair of train guards. A pair of grave diggers. When it came down to it, one of them called the shots. The other did what he was told. The question is, what if the other is a lot more than one? Mistakes, mistakes, its all I seem capable of at times. For two days, I went about my business. I traveled the globe as always, handing souls to the conveyor belt of eternity. I watched them trundle passively on. Several times, I warned myself that I should keep a good distance from the burial of Liesel Memingers brother. I did not heed my advice. From miles away, as I approached, I could already see the small group of humans standing frigidly among the wasteland of snow. The cemetery welcomed me like a friend, and soon, I was with them. I bowed my head. Standing to Liesels left, the grave diggers were rubbing their hands together and whining about the snow and the current digging conditions. So hard getting through all the ice, and so forth. One of them couldnt have been more than fourteen. An apprentice. When he walked away, after a few dozen paces, a black book fell innocuously from his coat pocket without his knowledge. A few minutes later, Liesels mother started leaving with the priest. She was thanking him for his performance of the ceremony. The girl, however, stayed. Her knees entered the ground. Her moment had arrived. Still in disbelief, she started to dig. He couldnt be dead. He couldnt be dead. He couldnt— Within seconds, snow was carved into her skin. Frozen blood was cracked across her hands. Somewhere in all the snow, she could see her broken heart, in two pieces. Each half was glowing, and beating under all that white. She realized her mother had come back for her only when she felt the boniness of a hand on her shoulder. She was being dragged away. A warm scream filled her throat. A SMALL IMAGE, PERHAPS * TWENTY METERS AWAY When the dragging was done, the mother and the girl stood and breathed. There was something black and rectangular lodged in the snow. Only the girl saw it. She bent down and picked it up and held it firmly in her fingers. The book had silver writing on it. They held hands. A final, soaking farewell was let go of, and they turned and left the cemetery, looking back several times. As for me, I remained a few moments longer. I waved. No one waved back. Mother and daughter vacated the cemetery and made their way toward the next train to Munich. Both were skinny and pale. Both had sores on their lips. Liesel noticed it in the dirty, fogged-up window of the train when they boarded just before midday. In the written words of the book thief herself, the journey continued like everything had happened. When the train pulled into the Bahnhof in Munich, the passengers slid out as if from a torn package. There were people of every stature, but among them, the poor were the most easily recognized. The impoverished always try to keep moving, as if relocating might help. They ignore the reality that a new version of the same old problem will be waiting at the end of the trip—the relative you cringe to kiss. I think her mother knew this quite well. She wasnt delivering her children to the higher echelons of Munich, but a foster home had apparently been found, and if nothing else, the new family could at least feed the girl and the boy a little better, and educate them properly. The boy. Liesel was sure her mother carried the memory of him, slung over her shoulder. She dropped him. She saw his feet and legs and body slap the platform. How could that woman walk? How could she move? Thats the sort of thing Ill never know, or comprehend—what humans are capable of. She picked him up and continued walking, the girl clinging now to her side. Authorities were met and questions of lateness and the boy raised their vulnerable heads. Liesel remained in the corner of the small, dusty office as her mother sat with clenched thoughts on a very hard chair. There was the chaos of goodbye. It was a goodbye that was wet, with the girls head buried into the woolly, worn shallows of her mothers coat. There had been some more dragging. Quite a way beyond the outskirts of Munich, there was a town called Molching, said best by the likes of you and me as Molking. Thats where they were taking her, to a street by the name of Himmel. A TRANSLATION Himmel = Heaven Whoever named Himmel Street certainly had a healthy sense of irony. Not that it was a living hell. It wasnt. But it sure as hell wasnt heaven, either. Regardless, Liesels foster parents were waiting. The Hubermanns. Theyd been expecting a girl and a boy and would be paid a small allowance for having them. Nobody wanted to be the one to tell Rosa Hubermann that the boy didnt survive the trip. In fact, no one ever really wanted to tell her anything. As far as dispositions go, hers wasnt really enviable, although she had a good record with foster kids in the past. Apparently, shed straightened a few out. For Liesel, it was a ride in a car. Shed never been in one before. There was the constant rise and fall of her stomach, and the futile hopes that theyd lose their way or change their minds. Among it all, her thoughts couldnt help turning toward her mother, back at the Bahnhof, waiting to leave again. Shivering. Bundled up in that useless coat. Shed be eating her nails, waiting for the train. The platform would be long and uncomfortable—a slice of cold cement. Would she keep an eye out for the approximate burial site of her son on the return trip? Or would sleep be too heavy? The car moved on, with Liesel dreading the last, lethal turn. The day was gray, the color of Europe. Curtains of rain were drawn around the car. Nearly there. The foster care lady, Frau Heinrich, turned around and smiled. Dein neues Heim. Your new home. Liesel made a clear circle on the dribbled glass and looked out. A PHOTO OF HIMMEL STREET The buildings appear to be glued together, mostly small houses and apartment blocks that look nervous. There is murky snow spread out like carpet. There is concrete, empty hat-stand trees, and gray air. A man was also in the car. He remained with the girl while Frau Heinrich disappeared inside. He never spoke. Liesel assumed he was there to make sure she wouldnt run away or to force her inside if she gave them any trouble. Later, however, when the trouble did start, he simply sat there and watched. Perhaps he was only the last resort, the final solution. After a few minutes, a very tall man came out. Hans Hubermann, Liesels foster father. On one side of him was the medium-height Frau Heinrich. On the other was the squat shape of Rosa Hubermann, who looked like a small wardrobe with a coat thrown over it. There was a distinct waddle to her walk. Almost cute, if it wasnt for her face, which was like creased-up cardboard and annoyed, as if she was merely tolerating all of it. Her husband walked straight, with a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. He rolled his own. The fact was this: Liesel would not get out of the car. Was ist los mit dem Kind? Rosa Hubermann inquired. She said it again. Whats wrong with this child? She stuck her face inside the car and said, Na, komm. Komm. The seat in front was flung forward. A corridor of cold light invited her out. She would not move. Outside, through the circle shed made, Liesel could see the tall mans fingers, still holding the cigarette. Ash stumbled from its edge and lunged and lifted several times until it hit the ground. It took nearly fifteen minutes to coax her from the car. It was the tall man who did it. Quietly. There was the gate next, which she clung to. A gang of tears trudged from her eyes as she held on and refused to go inside. People started to gather on the street until Rosa Hubermann swore at them, after which they reversed back, whence they came. A TRANSLATION OF ROSA HUBERMANNS ANNOUNCEMENT What are you assholes looking at? Eventually, Liesel Meminger walked gingerly inside. Hans Hubermann had her by one hand. Her small suitcase had her by the other. Buried beneath the folded layer of clothes in that suitcase was a small black book, which, for all we know, a fourteen-year-old grave digger in a nameless town had probably spent the last few hours looking for. I promise you, I imagine him saying to his boss, I have no idea what happened to it. Ive looked everywhere. Everywhere Im sure he would never have suspected the girl, and yet, there it was—a black book with silver words written against the ceiling of her clothes: THE GRAVE DIGGERS HANDBOOK A Twelve-Step Guide to Grave-Digging Success Published by the Bayern Cemetery Association The book thief had struck for the first time—the beginning of an illustrious career.My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt — sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that Id been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. It was to Forks that I now exiled myself— an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. Bella, my mom said to me — the last of a thousand times — before I got on the plane. You dont have to do this. My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my'

const midac = 'loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still  I want to go, I lied. Id always been a bad liar, but Id been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. Tell Charlie I said hi. I will. Ill see you soon, she insisted. You can come home whenever you want — Ill come right back as soon as you need me. But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise. Dont worry about me, I urged. Itll be great. I love you, Mom. She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. Its a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesnt bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. Hed already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didnt know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision — like my mother before me, I hadnt made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didnt see it as an omen — just unavoidable. Id already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too. Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. Its good to see you, Bells, he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me. You havent changed much. Hows Renée? Moms fine. Its good to see you, too, Dad. I wasnt allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. I found a good car for you, really cheap, he announced when we were strapped in. What kind of car? I was suspicious of the way he said good car for you as opposed to just good car. Well, its a truck actually, a Chevy. Where did you find it? Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push? La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. No. He used to go fishing with us during the summer, Charlie prompted. That would explain why I didnt remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. Hes in a wheelchair now, Charlie continued when I didnt respond, so he cant drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap. What year is it? I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldnt ask. Well, Billys done a lot of work on the engine — its only a few years old, really. I hoped he didnt think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily. When did he buy it? He bought it in 1984, I think. Did he buy it new? Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties — or late fifties at the earliest, he admitted sheepishly. Ch — Dad, I dont really know anything about cars. I wouldnt be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldnt afford a mechanic  Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They dont build them like that anymore. The thing, I thought to myself  it had possibilities — as a nickname, at the very least. How cheap is cheap? After all, that was the part I couldnt compromise on. Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift. Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. You didnt need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car. I dont mind. I want you to be happy here. He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasnt comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. Thats really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it. No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didnt need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth — or engine. Well, now, youre welcome, he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks. We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldnt deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. It was too green — an alien planet. Eventually we made it to Charlies. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that hed bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had — the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new — well, new to me — truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didnt know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged — the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. Wow, Dad, I love it Thanks Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldnt be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chiefs cruiser. Im glad you like it, Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window — these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesnt hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasnt in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven — now fifty-eight — students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together — their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, Id never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond — a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps — all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didnt have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself — and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty — it was very clear, almost translucent-looking — but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasnt just physically that Id never fit in. And if I couldnt find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didnt relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didnt relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didnt matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning. I didnt sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldnt fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldnt fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last years. Those were embarrassing to look at — I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didnt want to be too early to school, but I couldnt stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket — which had the feel of a biohazard suit — and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldnt pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadnt expected. Finding the school wasnt difficult, though Id never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldnt see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door. Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than Id hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasnt enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up. Can I help you? Im Isabella Swan, I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chiefs flighty ex-wife, come home at last. Of course, she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for. I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school. She brought several sheets to the counter to show roe. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home Id lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldnt draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldnt have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck. I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didnt stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black 3 was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door. The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them. They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldnt be a standout here. I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name — not an encouraging response — and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed.'

const midae = 'I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte,  Chaucer, Faulkner. Id already read everything. That was comforting  and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. Youre Isabella Swan, arent you? He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. Bella, I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. Wheres your next class? he asked. I had to check in my bag. Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six. There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes. Im headed toward building four, I could show you the way  Definitely over-helpful. Im Eric, he added. I smiled tentatively. Thanks. We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasnt getting paranoid. So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh? he asked. Very. It doesnt rain much there, does it? Three or four times a year. Wow, what must that be like? he wondered. Sunny, I told him. You dont look very tan. My mother is part albino. He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didnt mix. A few months of this and Id forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. Well, good luck, he said as I touched the handle. Maybe well have some other classes together. He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside. The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldnt remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didnt try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They werent talking, and they werent eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They werent gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didnt look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big — muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes — purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular. But all this is not why I couldnt look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful — maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away — away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray — unopened soda, unbitten apple — and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancers step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. Who are they? I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name Id forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant — though already knowing, probably, from my tone — suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest — it was as if she had called his name, and hed looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer. My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did. Thats Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife. She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here — small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. They are  very nice-looking. I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. Yes Jessica agreed with another giggle. Theyre all together though — Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together. Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. Which ones are the Cullens? I asked. They dont look related  Oh, theyre not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. Theyre all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins — the blondes — and theyre foster children. They look a little old for foster children. They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but theyve been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. Shes their aunt or something like that. Thats really kind of nice — for them to take care of all those kids like that, when theyre so young and everything. I guess so, Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didnt like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy. I think that Mrs. Cullen cant have any kids, though, she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. Have they always lived in Forks? I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. No, she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me. They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska. I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasnt the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard.It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane. At first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the community. But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, looking around anxiously, had seen others- adults as well as children- stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event. Then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building and stay there. IMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through the speakers had said. LEAVE YOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY ARE. Instantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behind his familys dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed there, alone. His parents were both at work, and his little sister, Lily, was at the Childcare Center where she spent her after-school hours. Looking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of the busy afternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, and Food Delivery people who usually populated the community at that time of day. He saw only the abandoned bikes here and there on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly. He had been frightened then. The sense of his own community silent, waiting, had made his stomach churn. He had trembled. But it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled again, and the voice, reassuring now and less urgent, had explained that a Pilot-in-Training had misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately the Pilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed. NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, followed by silence. There was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement it had been. For a contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of failure. Even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. Jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, Thats it, Asher Youre released when Ashers clumsy error had lost a match for his team. He had been taken aside for a brief and serious talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment, and apologized to Asher after the game. Now, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path, he remembered that moment of palpab &lgrave; le, stomach-sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. It was not what he was feeling now with December approaching. He searched for the right word to describe his own feeling. Jonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny. Jonas grinned, remembering the morning that Asher had dashed into the classroom, late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle of the chanting of the morning anthem. When the class took their seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn, Asher remained standing to make his public apology as was required. I apologize for inconveniencing my learning community. Asher ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his breath. The Instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation. The students had all been grinning, because they had listened to Ashers explanations so many times before. I left home at the correct time but when I was riding along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. I guess I just got distraught, watching them. I apologize to my classmates, Asher concluded. He smoothed his rumpled tunic and sat down. We accept your apology, Asher. The class recited the standard response in unison. Many of the students were biting their lips to keep from laughing. I accept your apology, Asher, the Instructor said. He was smiling. And I thank you, because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson in language. Distraught is too strong an adjective to describe salmon-viewing. He turned and wrote distraught on the instructional board. Beside it he wrote distracted. Jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings, now that December was almost here. It was too strong an adjective. He had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost upon him, he wasnt frightened, but he was ... eager, he decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon. ；电话：40060-40012 But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, about what might happen. Apprehensive, Jonas decided. Thats what I am. Who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings? Jonass father asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal. It was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings. Sometimes Jonas and his sister, Lily, argued over turns, over who would get to go first. Their parents, of course, were part of the ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. But like all parents- all adults- they didnt fight and wheedle for their turn. Nor did Jonas, tonight. His feelings were too complicated this evening. He wanted to share them, but he wasnt eager to begin the process of sifting through his own complicated emotions, even with the help that he knew his parents could give. You go, Lily, he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger- only a Seven- wiggling with impatience in her chair. I felt very angry this afternoon, Lily announced. My Childcare group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, and they didnt obey the rules at all. One of them- a male; I dont know his name- kept going right to the front of the line for the slide, even though the rest of us were all waiting. I felt so angry at him. I made my hand into a fist, like this. She held up a clenched fist and the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture. Why do you think the visitors didnt obey the rules? Mother asked. Lily considered, and shook her head. I dont know. They acted like ... like Animals? Jonas suggested. He laughed. Thats right, Lily said, laughing too. Like animals. Neither child knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didnt fit in. Where were the visitors from? Father asked. Lily frowned, trying to remember. Our leader told us, when he made the welcome speech, but I cant remember. I guess I wasnt paying attention. It was from another community. They had to leave very early, and they had their midday meal on the bus. Mother nodded. Do you think its possible that their rules may be different? And so they simply didnt know what your play area rules were? Lily shrugged, and nodded. I suppose. Youve visited other communities, havent you? Jonas asked. My group has, often. Lily nodded again. When we were Sixes, we went and shared a whole school day with a group of Sixes in their community. How did you feel when you were there? ；电话：40060-40012 Lily frowned. I felt strange. Because their methods were different. They were learning usages that my group hadnt learned yet, so we felt stupid. Father was listening with interest. Im thinking, Lily, he said, about the boy who didnt obey the rules today. Do you think its possible that he felt strange and stupid, being in a new place with rules that he didnt know about? Lily pondered that. Yes, she said, finally. I feel a little sorry for him, Jonas said, even though I dont even know him. I feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid. How do you feel now, Lily? Father asked. Still angry? I guess not, Lily decided. I guess I feel a little sorry for him. And sorry I made a fist. She grinned. Jonas smiled back at his sister. Lilys feelings were always straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. He guessed that his own had been, too, when he was a Seven. He listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that hed had that day at work: a concern about one of the new children who wasnt doing well. Jonass fathers title was Nurturer. He and the other Nurturers were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every new child during its earliest life. It was a very important job, Jonas knew, but it wasnt one that interested him much. What gender is it? Lily asked. Male, Father said. Hes a sweet little male with a lovely disposition. But he isnt growing as fast as he should, and he doesnt sleep soundly. We have him in the extra care section for supplementary nurturing, but the committees beginning to talk about releasing him. Oh, no, Mother murmured sympathetically. I know how sad that must make you feel. Jonas and Lily both nodded sympathetically as well. Release of new children was always sad, because they hadnt had a chance to enjoy life within the community yet. And they hadnt done anything wrong. There were only two occasions of release which were not punishment. Release of the elderly, which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived; and release of a new child which always brought a sense of what-could-we-have-done. This was especially troubling for the Nurturers, like Father, who felt they had failed somehow. But it happened very rarely. Well, Father said, Im going to keep trying. I may ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night, if you dont mind. You know what the night-crew Nurturers are like. I think this little guy needs something extra. Of course, Mother said, and Jonas and Lily nodded. They had heard Father complain about the night crew before. It was a lesser job, night-crew nurturing, assigned to those who lacked the interest or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours. Most of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity ；电话：40060-40012 to connect to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit. Maybe we could even keep him, Lily suggested sweetly, trying to look innocent. The look was fake, Jonas knew; they all knew. Lily, Mother reminded her, smiling, you know the rules. Two children- one male, one female- to each family unit. It was written very clearly in the rules. Lily giggled. Well, she said, I thought maybe just this once. Next, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of Justice, talked about her feelings. Today a repeat offender had been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his home, his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And even guilt, that she hadnt made a difference in his life. I feel frightened, too, for him, she confessed. You know that theres no third chance. The rules say that if theres a third transgression, he simply has to be released. Jonas shivered. He knew it happened. There was even a boy in his group of Elevens whose father had been released years before. No one ever mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to imagine. Lily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mothers arm. From his place at the table'


const midab = 'Father reached over and took her hand. Jonas reached for the other. One by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, and murmured that she felt soothed. The ritual continued. Jonas? Father asked. Youre last, tonight. Jonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelings hidden. But it was, of course, against the rules. Im feeling apprehensive, he confessed, glad that the appropriate descriptive word had finally come to him. Why is that, son? His father looked concerned. I know theres really nothing to worry about, Jonas explained, and that every adult has been through it. I know you have, Father, and you too, Mother. But its the Ceremony that Im apprehensive about. Its almost December. Lily looked up, her eyes wide. The Ceremony of Twelve, she whispered in an awed voice. Even the smallest children- Lilys age and younger- knew that it lay in the future for each of them. Im glad you told us of your feelings, Father said. Lily, Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, go on now and get into your nightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk to Jonas for a while. ；电话：40060-40012 Lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. Privately? she asked. Mother nodded. Yes, she said, this talk will be a private one with Jonas. Chapter 2 Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee. He waited. You know, his father finally said, every December was exciting to me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, Im sure. Each December brings such changes. Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to when he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lilys earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One. The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all the new children born in the previous year turned One. One at a time- there were always fifty in each years group, if none had been released- they had been brought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers. I enjoy the Naming, Jonas said. His mother agreed, smiling. The year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that wed receive our female, because wed made our application and been approved. But Id been wondering and wondering what her name would be. I could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony, Father confided. The committee always makes the list in advance, and its right there in the office at the Nurturing Center. As a matter of fact, he went on, I feel a little guilty about this. But I did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this years Naming list had been made yet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up number Thirty-six- thats the little guy Ive been concerned about- because it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if I could call him by a name. Just privately, of course, when no one else is around. Did you find it? Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didnt seem a terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him. He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling. His father nodded. His name- if he makes it to the Naming without being released, of course- is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him when I feed him every four hours, and during exercise and playtime. If no one can hear me. I call him Gabe, actually, he said, and grinned. Gabe. Jonas tried it out. A good name, he decided. Though Jonas had only become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learned her name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, wondering about her: how she would look, ；电话：40060-40012 who she would be, how she would fit into their established family unit. He remembered climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his side that year instead of with the Nurturers, since it was the year that he would be given a new child of his own. He remembered his mother taking the new child his sister, into her arms, while the document was read to the assembled family units. Newchild Twenty-three, the Namer had read. Lily. He remembered his fathers look of delight, and that his father had whispered, Shes one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be the one. The crowd had clapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked his sisters name. Lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist. Then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit. When I was an Eleven, his father said now, as you are, Jonas, I was very impatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. Its a long two days. I remember that I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but that I didnt pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for my sisters. She became a Nine that year, and got her bicycle. Id been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically I wasnt supposed to. Jonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously and was almost always broken. The children all received their bicycles at Nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then. But almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones. Jonas had been thinking already about teaching Lily. There was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlier age. A committee was studying the idea. When something went to a committee for study, the people always joked about it. They said that the committee members would become Elders by the time the rule change was made. Rules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very important rule -unlike the one governing the age for bicycles- it would have to go, eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The Receiver was the most important Elder. Jonas had never even seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position of such importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never bother The Receiver with a question about bicycles; they would simply fret and argue about it themselves for years, until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study. His father continued. So I watched and cheered when my sister, Katya, became a Nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle, Father went on. Then I didnt pay much attention to the Tens and Elevens. And finally, at the end of the second day, which seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy and quiet boy, for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his group, waiting to be called to the stage. The Ceremony of Twelve was the last of the Ceremonies. The most important. I remember how proud my parents looked- and my sister, too; even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn came. But to be honest, Jonas, his father said, for me there was not the element of suspense that there ；电话：40060-40012 is with your Ceremony. Because I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment was to be. Jonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in advance. It was a secret selection, made by the leaders of the community, the Committee of Elders, who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokes made about Assignments. His mother seemed surprised, too. How could you have known? she asked. His father smiled his gentle smile. Well, it was clear to me-and my parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them, too- what my aptitude was. I had always loved the new children more than anything. When my friends in my are group were holding bicycle races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction sets, or- All the things I do with my friends, Jonas pointed out, and his mother nodded in agreement. I always participated, of course, because as children we must experience all of those things. And I studied hard in school, as you do, Jonas. But again and again, during free time, I found myself drawn to the new children I spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, from their observation. Jonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the increasing level of observation. In school, at recreation time, and during volunteer hours, he had noticed the Elders watching him and the other Elevens. He had seen them taking notes. He knew, too, that the Elders were meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the other Elevens had had during their years of school. So I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when my Assignment was announced as Nurturer, Father explained. Did everyone applaud, even though they werent surprised? Jonas asked. Oh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was what I wanted most. I felt very fortunate. His father smiled. Were any of the Elevens disappointed, your year? Jonas asked. Unlike his father, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. But he knew that some would disappoint him. Though he respected his fathers work, Nurturer would not be his wish. And he didnt envy Laborers at all. His father thought. No, I dont think so. Of course the Elders are so careful in their observations and selections. I think its probably the most important job in our community, his mother commented. My friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor, Father said, but she was thrilled. And lets see, there was Andrei -- I remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical things. He spent all the recreation time he could with his construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building sites. The Elders knew that, of course. Andrei was given the Assignment of Engineer and he was delighted. Andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west of town, Jonass mother said. It wasnt there when we were children. ；电话：40060-40012 There are very rarely disappointments, Jonas. I dont think you need to worry about that, his father reassured him. And if there are, you know theres an appeal process. But they all laughed at that- an appeal went to a committee for study. I worry a little about Ashers Assignment, Jonas confessed. Ashers such fun. But he doesnt really have any serious interests. He makes a game out of everything. His father chuckled. You know, he said, I remember when Asher was a new child at the Nurturing Center, before he was named. He never cried. He giggled and laughed at everything. All of us on the staff enjoyed nurturing Asher. The Elders know Asher, his mother said. Theyll find exactly the right Assignment for him. I dont think you need to worry about him. But, Jonas, let me warn you about something that may not have occurred to you. I know I didnt think about it until after my Ceremony of Twelve. Whats that? Well, its the last of the Ceremonies, as you know. After Twelve, age isnt important. Most of us even lose track of how old we are as time passes, though the information is in the Hall of Open Records, and we could go and look it up if we wanted to. Whats important is the preparation for adult life, and the training youll receive in your Assignment. I Know that, Jonas said. Everyone knows that. But it means, his mother went on, that youll move into a new group. And each of your friends will. Youll no longer be spending your time with your group of Elevens. After the Ceremony of Twelve, youll be with your Assignment group, with those in training. No more volunteer hours. No more recreation hours. So your friends will no longer be as close. Jonas shook his head. Asher and I will always be friends, he said firmly. And there will still be school. Thats true, his father agreed. But what your mother said is true as well. There will be changes. Good changes, though, his mother pointed out. After my Ceremony of Twelve, I missed my childhood recreation. But when I entered my training for Law and Justice, I found myself with people who shared my interests. I made friends on a new level, friends of all ages. Did you still play at all, after Twelve? Jonas asked. Occasionally, his mother replied. But didnt seem as important to me. I did, his father said, laughing. I still do. Every day, at the Nurturing Center, I play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and hug-the-teddy. He reached over and stroked Jonass neatly trimmed hair. Fun doesnt end when you become Twelve. Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave an impatient sigh. This is ；电话：40060-40012 certainly a very long private conversation, she said. And there are certain people waiting for their comfort object. Lily, her mother said fondly, Youre very close to being an Eight, and when youre an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to go off to sleep without it. But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lilys, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonass had been called a bear. Here you are, Lily-billy, he said. Ill come help you remove your hair ribbons. Jonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched affectionately as Lily and her father headed to her sleeping-room with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort object when she was born. His mother moved to her big desk and opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even when she was at home in the evening. Jonas went to his own desk and began to sort through his school papers for the evenings assignment. But his mind was still on December and the coming Ceremony. Though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he hadnt the slightest idea what Assignment the Elders would be selecting for his future, or how he might feel about it when the day came. Chapter 3 Oh, look Lily squealed in delight. Isnt he cute? Look how tiny he is And he has funny eyes like yours, Jonas Jonas glared at her. He didnt like it that she had mentioned his eyes. He waited for his father to chastise Lily. But Father was busy unstrapping the carrying basket from the back of his bicycle. Jonas walked over to look. It was the first thing Jonas noticed as he looked at the new child peering up curiously from the basket. The pale eyes. Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. His parents did, and Lily did, and so did all of his group members and friends. But there were a few exceptions: Jonas himself, and a female Five who he had noticed had the different, lighter eyes. No one mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about individuals. Lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, or she would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive chatter. Father put his bike into its port. Then he picked up the basket and carried it into the house. Lily followed behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder at Jonas and teased, Maybe he had the same Birthmother as you. Jonas shrugged. He followed them inside. But he had been startled by the new child eyes. Mirrors were rare in the community; they werent forbidden, but there was no real need of them, and Jonas had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when he found ：40060-40012 himself in a location where a mirror existed. Now, seeing the new child and its expression, he was reminded that the light eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a certain look -what was it? Depth, he decided; as if one were looking into the clear water of the river, down to the bottom, where things might lurk which hadnt been discovered yet. He felt self-conscious, realizing that he, too, had that look. He went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the new child On the other side of the room, Mother and Lily were bending over to watch as Father unwrapped its blanket. Whats his comfort object called? Lily asked, picking up the stuffed creature which had been placed beside the new child in his basket. Father glanced at it. Hippo, he said. Lily giggled at the strange word. Hippo, she repeated, and put the comfort object down again. She peered at the unwrapped new child who waved his arms. I think new children are so cute, Lily sighed. I hope I get assigned to be a Birthmother. Lily Mother spoke very sharply. Dont say that. Theres very little honor in that Assignment. But I was talking to Natasha. You know the Ten who lives around the corner? She does some of her volunteer hours at the Birthing Center. And she told me that the Birthmothers get wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods, and most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while theyre waiting. I think Id like that, Lily said petulantly. Three years, Mother told her firmly. Three births, and thats all. After that they are Laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the day that they enter the House of the Old. Is that what you want, Lily? Three lazy years, and then hard physical labor until you are old? Well, no, I guess not, Lily acknowledged reluctantly. Father turned the new child onto his tummy in the basket. He sat beside it and rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. Anyway, Lily-billy, he said affectionately, the Birthmothers never even get to see new children If you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope for an Assignment as Nurturer. When youre an Eight and start your volunteer hours, you can try some at the Nurturing Center, Mother suggested. Yes, I think I will, Lily said. She knelt beside the basket. What did you say his name is? Gabriel? Hello, Gabriel, she said in a singsong voice. Then she giggled. Ooops, she whispered. I think hes al seep I guess Id better be quiet. Jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk. Some chance of that, he thought. Lily was never quiet. Probably she should hope for an Assignment as Speaker, so that she could sit in the office with the microphone all day, making announcements. He laughed silently to himself, picturing his sister droning on in the self-important voice that all the Speakers seemed to develop, saying things like ；电话：40060-40012 ATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO FEMALES UNDER NINE THAT HAIR RIBBONS ARE TO BE NEATLY TIED AT ALL TIMES. He turned toward Lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her ribbons were, as usual, undone and dangling. There would be an announcement like that quite soon, he felt certain, and it would be directed mainly at Lily, though her name, of course, would not be mentioned. Everyone would know. Everyone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the announcement ATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO MALE ELEVENS THAT OBJECTS ARE NOT TO BE REMOVED FROM THE RECREATION AREA AND THAT SNACKS ARE TO BE EATEN, NOT HOARDED had been specifically directed at him, the day last month that he had taken an apple home. No one had mentioned it, not even his parents, because the public announcement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate remorse. He had, of course, disposed of the apple and made his apology to the Recreation Director the next morning, before school. Jonas thought again about that incident. He was still bewildered by it. Not by the announcement or the necessary apology; those were standard procedures, and he had deserved them- but by the incident itself. He probably should have brought up his feeling of bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared their feelings of the day. But he had not been able to sort out and put words to the source of his confusion, so he had let it pass. It had happened during the recreation period, when he had been playing with Asher. Jonas had casually picked up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept, and had thrown it to his friend. Asher had thrown it back, and they had begun a simple game of catch. There had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he had performed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. It was effortless for Jonas, and even boring, though Asher enjoyed it, and playing catch was a required activity for Asher because it would improve his hand-eye coordination, which was not up to standards. But suddenly Jonas had noticed, following the path of the apple through the air with his eyes, that the piece of fruit had-well, this was the part that he couldnt adequately understand-the apple had changed. Just for an instant. It had changed in mid-air, he remembered. Then it was in his hand, and he looked at it carefully, but it was the same apple. Unchanged. The same size and shape: a perfect sphere. The same nondescript shade, about the same shade as his own tunic. There was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. He had tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times, then thrown it again to Asher. And again- in the air, for an instant only- it had changed. It had happened four times. Jonas had blinked, looked around, and then tested his eyesight, Sometimes he whispered his real name in the dark, in the middle of the night. Luke. My name is Luke. He was sure no one could hear. His roommates were all asleep, and even if they werent, there was no way the sound of his name could travel even the short distance to the bed above or beside him. He was fairly certain there were no bugs on him or in his room. Hed looked. But even if hed missed seeing a microphone hidden in a mattress button or carved into the headboard, how could a microphone pick up a whisper he could barely hear himself? He was safe now. Lying in bed, wide awake while everyone else slept, he reassured himself of that fact constantly. But his heart pounded and his face went clammy with fear every time he rounded his lips for that u sound—instead of the fake smile of the double ~ in Lee, the name he had to force himself to answer to now. It was better to forget, to never speak his real name again. But hed lost everything else. Even just mouthing his name was a comfort. It seemed like his only link now to his past, to his parents, his brothers. To Jen. By day, he kept his mouth shut. He couldnt help it. That first day, walking up the stairs of the Hendricks School for Boys with Jens father, Luke had felt his jaw clench tighter and tighter the closer he got to the front door. Oh, dont look like that, Mr. Talbot had said, pretending to be jolly. Its not reform school or anything. The word stuck in Lukes brain. Reform. Re-form. Yes, they were going to re-form him. They were going to take a Luke and make him a Lee. It was safe to be Lee. It wasnt safe to be Luke. Jens father stood with his hand on the ornate doorknob, waiting for a reply. But Luke couldnt have said a word if his life depended on it. Jens father hesitated, then pulled on the heavy door. They walked down a long hallway. The ceiling was so far away, Luke thought he could have stood his entire family on his shoulders—one on top of the other, Dad and Mother and Matthew and Mark—and the highest one still would barely touch. The walls were lined, floor to ceiling, with old paintings of people in costumes Luke had never seen outside of books. Of course, there was very little hed ever seen outside of books. He tried not to stare, because if he really were Lee, surely everything would look familiar and ordinary. But that was hard to remember. They passed a classroom where dozens of boys sat in orderly rows, everyone facing away from the door. Luke gawked for so long that he practically began walking backwards. Hed known there were a lot of people in the world, but hed never been able to imagine so many all in one Among The Impostors 02 The Shadow Children Series Margaret Peterson Haddix place at the same time. Were any of them shadow children with fake identities, like Luke? Jens father clapped a hand on his shoulder, turning him around. Ah, heres the headmasters office, Mr. Talbot said heartily. Just what we were looking for. Luke nodded, still mute, and followed him through a tall doorway. A woman sitting behind a mammoth wood desk turned their way She took one look at Luke and asked, New boy? Lee Grant, Jens father said. I spoke with the master about him last night. Its the middle of the semester, you know, she said warningly. Unless hes very well prepared, he shant catch up, and might have to repeat That wont be a problem, Mr. Talbot assured her. Luke was glad he didnt have to speak for himself. He knew he wasnt well prepared. He wasnt prepared for anything. The woman was already reaching for files and papers. His parents faxed in his medical information and his insurance standing and his academic records last night, she said. But someone needs to sign these— Jens father took the stack of papers as if he autographed other peoples documents all the time. Probably he did. Luke watched Mr. Talbot flip through the papers, scrawling his name here, crossing out a word or a phrase or a whole paragraph there. Luke was sure Jens father was going too fast to actually read any of it. And that was when the homesickness hit Luke for the first time. He could just picture his own father peering cautiously at important papers, reading them over and over before he even picked up a pen. Luke could see his fathers rheumy eyes squinted in concentration, his brow furrowed with anxiety. He was always so afraid of being tricked. Maybe Jens father didnt care. Luke had to swallow hard then. He made a gulping noise, and the woman looked at him. Luke couldnt read her expression. Curiosity? Contempt? Indifference? He didnt think it was sympathy. Jens father finished then, handing the papers back to the woman with a flourish. Ill call a boy to show you your room, the woman said to Luke. Luke nodded. The woman leaned over a box on her desk and said, Mr. Dirk, could you send Rolly Sturgeon to the office? Luke heard a roar along with the mans reply, Yes, Ms. Hawkins, as if all the boys in the school were laughing and cheering and hissing at once. Luke felt his legs go weak with fear. When this Rolly Sturgeon showed up, Luke wasnt sure hed be able to walk. Well, Ill be off, Jens father said. Duty calls. He stuck out his hand and after a moment Luke realized he was supposed to shake it. But hed never shaken hands with anyone before, so he put out the wrong hand first Jens father frowned, moving his head violently side to side, and glaring pointedly at the woman behind the desk. Fortunately, she wasnt watching. Luke recovered. He clumsily touched his hand to Jens fathers. Good luck, Jens father said, bringing his other hand up to Lukes, too. Only when Mr. Talbot had pulled both hands away did Luke realize hed placed a tiny scrap of paper between Lukes fingers. Luke held it there until the woman turned her back Then he slid it into his pocket. Jens father smiled. Keep those grades up, he said. And no running away this time, you hear? Luke gulped again, and nodded. And then Jens father left without a backward glance. Two Luke wanted to read the note from Mr. Talbot right away. He was sure it would tell him everything— everything he needed to know to survive Hendricks School for Boys. No—to survive anything that might come his way in this new life, outside hiding. It was just one thin scrap of paper. Now that it was in his pocket, Luke couldnt even feel it there. But he had faith. Jens father had hidden Luke from the Population Police, double-crossing his own employer. Hed gotten Luke his fake I.D., so he could move about as freely as anyone else, anyone who wasnt an illegal third child. Jens father had risked his career helping Luke. No, it was more than that—hed risked his life. Surely Mr. Talbot would have written something incredibly wise. Luke slid his hand into his pocket, his fingertips touching the top of the note. Ms. Hawkins was looking away. Maybe— The door opened behind Luke. Luke jerked his hand out of his pocket. Scared you, didnt I? a boy jeered. Made you jump. Luke was used to being teased. He had older brothers, after all. But Matthew and Marks teasing never sounded quite so mean. Still, Luke knew he had to answer. Sure. Im jumpy like a cat, Luke started to say. It was an expression of his mothers. Being cat-jumpy was good. Like being quick on his feet. Just in time, Luke remembered he couldnt mention cats. Cats were illegal, too, outlawed because they might take food that was supposed to go to starving humans. Back home, Luke had seen wild cats a few times, stalking the countryside. Dad had liked having them around because they ate rats and mice that might eat his grain. But if Luke were really Lee Grant, filthy-rich city boy, he wouldnt know a thing about cats, jumpy or otherwise. He clamped his mouth shut, closing off his Sure— in a wimpy hiss. He kept his head down, too scared to look the other boy right in the eye. The boy laughed, cruelly. He looked past Luke, to Ms. Hawkins. Whats wrong with him? the boy asked, as if Luke werent even there. Cant talk or something? Luke wanted Ms. Hawkins to stick up for him, to say, Hes just new. Dont you remember what thats like? But she wasnt even paying attention. She frowned at the boy. Rolly, take him to room one fifty-six. Theres an empty bed in there. Just put his suitcase down. Dont waste time unpacking. Then take him back to Mr. Dirks history class with you. Hes already behind. Lord knows what his parents were thinking. Rolly shrugged and turned around. I did not dismiss you Ms. Hawkins shrieked. May I be dismissed? Rolly asked mockingly. Thats better, Ms. Hawkins said. Now, get. Go on with you. Luke picked up his suitcase and followed, hoping Rollys request for dismissal would work for both of them. Either it did, or Ms. Hawkins didnt care. In the hallway, Rolly took big steps. He was a good head taller than Luke, and had longer legs. It was all Luke could do to keep up, what with the suitcase banging against his ankles. Rolly looked back over his shoulder, and started walking faster. He raced up a long stairway By the time Luke reached the top, Rolly was nowhere in sight. Boo Rally leaped out from behind the newel post. Luke jumped so high, he lost his balance and teetered on the edge of the stairs. Rally reached out, and Luke thought, See, hes not so bad. Hes going to catch me. But Rally pushed instead. Luke fell backwards. He might have :umbled down all the stairs, except that Rallys push was crooked, and Luke landed on the railing. Pain shot hrough his back. Rally laughed. Got you good, didnt I? he said. Then, strangely, he grabbed Lukes bag and took off own the hall. Luke was afraid he was stealing it. He galloped after Rally. Rolly screamed with laughter, maniacally. This was not what Luke had expected. Rally dodged around a corner and Luke followed him. Rolly discovered a secret about Lukes bag that Luke had missed—it was on wheels. So Rally could run at full-speed with the bag rolling behind him. He careened this way and that, the bag zigzagging from side to side. Luke got close enough to tackle it if he wanted, but he hesitated. If the bag had been full of his own clothes, all the hand-me-down jeans and flannel shirts hed gotten after Matthew and Mark outgrew them, he would have leaped. But the bag held Baron clothes, stiff shirts and shiny pants that were supposed to make him look like Lee Grant, instead of Luke Garner. He couldnt risk ruining them. He focused on Rally instead. Instinctively, Luke dove over the bag to catch Rallys legs. It was like playing football. Rally fell to the ground with a crash. Just what is the meaning of this? a man~s voice boomed above them. Rally was instantly on his feet. He attacked me, sir, Rally said. I was showing the new boy his room and he attacked me. Luke opened his mouth to protest, but nothing came out Hed learned that from Matthew and Marlc Dont tattle. The man looked dismissively from Rally to Luke. What is your name, young man? Luke froze. He had to stop himself from saying his real name automatically. Then he had a split second of fearing he wouldnt be able to remember the name he was supposed to use. Was he taking too long? The mans glare intensified. L-L-Lee. Lee Grant, Luke finally stammered. Well, Mr. Grant, the man snapped. This is a fine way to begin your academic career at Hendricks. You and Mr. Sturgeon each have two demerits for this disgraceful display. You may report to my room after the final bell to do your time. But, sir, I told you, Rally protested. He attacked me. Very well, Mr. Sturgeon. Make that three demerits for each of you. But— Rally was undeterred. Four. Rolly was going to complain again. Luke could tell by the way he was standing. But the man turned away and began walking down the hall, as if Rally and Luke were both too unimportant to bother with, and hed wasted enough time already. Lukes head swam with questions. What were demerits? When was final bell? Where was this mans room? Who was he, anyway? Luke tried to muster up the nerve to call after the man—or to ask Rally, which seemed even more dangerous. But then he was blindsided with a shove that sent him crashing into the wall. Fonrol Rolly exploded. Luke slumped against the wall. Hi~ shoulder throbbed. Why did Rolly seem to hate him so much? Well, come on, you little exnay, Rally taunted. Want to get demerits from Mr. Dirk, too? He stepped backwards, tugging on Lukes suitcase. Then he shoved it through a nearby doorway. Luke looked up and saw 156 etched on a copper plaque on the door. Relief overwhelmed him. Finally something made sense. This was his room. The rest of the day would be horrible—hed already resigned himself to that. But eventually it would be night, and hed be sent to bed, and he could come to this room and shut the door. And then he could read the note from Jens dad, if he didnt get a chance to read it before bedtime. Come nightfall, hed know everything and be safe, alone in his own room. Imagining the haven that awaited him in only a matter of hours, he got brave enough to peek around the corner. The room held eight beds. Seven of them were made up, with rich blue spreads stretched tautly from top to bottom. Only one, a lower bunk, was covered just by sheets. Luke felt as desolate as that bed looked. He knew it was his. And he knew he wouldnt get to be alone in this room. He probably wouldnt be safe, either, not if any of his seven roommates were anything like Rally He edged his hand into his pocket, his fingers brushing the note from Jens dad. What if he just pulled it out and read it now, right in front of Rally? He didnt dare. The way the last ten minutes had gone, Rally would probably rip the note to shreds before Luke even had it completely out of his pocket. And Jens dad had acted like, it was secret. If Ms. Hawkins wasnt supposed to see it, there was no way Rally could be trusted. Rally hit Luke on the shoulder. Tag Youre it he hollered, and took off running. Panicked, Luke chased after him. Three Luke managed to keep up with Rolly only because Rolly slowed to a dignified walk when he began passing classrooms instead of sleeping quarters. But it was a fast dignified walk, and Luke was terrified that Rolly might dart around a corner unexpectedly and disappear. Then Luke would be totally lost. So Luke dared to jog a little, hoping to keep pace. A tall, thin man with a skimpy mustache came out of one of the rooms as Luke passed by. ~Tho demerits, young man, he said to Luke. No running allowed. You know the rules. Luke didnt, and didnt have the nerve to say so. Rolly smirked. The thin man went back into his classroom. Luke knew hed have to risk asking Rolly a question. ~Wha— he began. But just then Rolly opened a tall, wooden door to one side of the hall and slipped through. Lukes reflexes werent fast enough. The door shut behind Rolly and then Luke had to fumble with the knob. It was ornate and gold, and had to be turned further to the right than all the doorknobs at home. Home... For the second time in less than an hour, Luke was overcome with an almost unbearable wave of homesickness. Stupid, Luke chided himself How can you be homesick for doorknobs? Blinking quickly, he shoved on the door and it gave way Blindly, he stepped in. He was at the back of a huge classroom. Boys sat in row upon row upon row, dozens of them, it seemed to Luke, all the way to the front of the room. There, the tall, thin man whod just given Luke demerits was writing on the wall. Or was it the same man? Luke squinted, confused. Oh. There was a door at the front of the room, too. That was the door the man had used. But had Luke and Rolly really walked so far between the doors? Suddenly, Luke wasnt sure of anything. Luke scanned the row of boys in front of him, looking for Rolly He was supposed to stay close to Rolly, so thats what hed do. But now he couldnt even remember if Rolly had brown hair or black, short or long, curly or straight. Hed really never looked that closely at Rolly, just followed him and gotten beat up by him. Any of the heads in front of him might belong to Rolly The man at the front of the class turned around. And the Greeks were—sit down— he interrupted himself impatiently He was looking at Luke. M-Me? Luke squeaked. W-Where should I sit? His voice wasnt much more than a whisper. There was no way the man could have heard him, all the way at the front of the room. Probably the boy sitting a foot away hadnt even heard him. But suddenly every boy in the room turned around and stared at Luke. It was awful. All those eyes, all looking at him. It was straight out of Lukes worst nightmares. Panic rooted him to the spot, but every muscle in his body was screaming for him to run, to hide anywhere he could. For twelve years—his entire life—hed had to hide. To be seen was death. Dont he wanted to scream. Dont look at me Dont report me Please But the mqscles that controlled his mouth were as frozen as the rest of him. The tiny part of his mind that wasnt flooded with panic knew that that was good—now that he had a fake I.D., the last thing he should do was act like a boy whos had to hide. But to act normal, he needed to move, to obey the man at the front and sit down. And he couldnt make his body do that, either. Then someone kicked him. Ow Luke crumbled. Rough hands jerked him backwards. Miraculously, he landed on the corner of a chair, barely regained his balance, and managed not to fall completely. He slid to his right and was solidly in the seat. Thank you, the man at the front said with exaggerated, mocking gratitude. See me after class. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the Greeks were quite technologically advanced for their time.... Then Luke could no longer hear the mans words over the buzzing in his ears. His heart kept thumping hard, as if it, at least, still thought Luke would be wise to run. But Luke resolutely gripped the edge of the chair. He was acting normal now. Wasnt he? The boys who had been staring at him slowly began turning back to face the teacher again. Luke wiped sweat from his forehead and looked around for whoever had kicked and pulled and shoved him. Had they been trying to help him? Luke desperately wanted to believe that. But all the boys near him were looking at the teacher, nonchalantly as though Luke werent even there. And if theyd been trying to help, wouldnt they be trying to catch Lukes eye, to get him to say thanks? Luke really didnt know. He knew how his family would act—Mother and Dad, Matthew and Mark. Mother and Dad would never kick him, and his older brothers would be poking him now, taunting him, Want us to kick you again? The only other people Luke had ever met before today were Jens dad—who was practically as big a mystery as the boys sitting beside him now—and Jen. And Jen would... Luke couldnt bear to think about Jen. A bell rang suddenly and it was such an alarming sound that Lukes heart set to pounding again. Remember Chapter twelve the teacher called as all the boys scrambled up. Luke meant to go see the teacher, as hed been instructed. This had to be the end of the class. But the tide of boys swept him out the back door of the classroom before he quite knew what was happening. By the time he got his feet firmly on the ground, and felt like he might be able to break away he was around a corner and down another hall. He fought his way back to what he thought was the original hallway But then he couldnt figure out which way to turn. He looked all around, frantically searching for either the teacher or Rolly—as nasty as hed been, Rolly was at least sort of familiar. But all the faces that flowed past him were strangerss Of course, the way Lukes mind was working, both Rolly and the teacher could have paraded past Luke five times and he might not have even recognized them. The crowd in the hall was thinning out. Luke began to panic again. Get to class, an older boy standing nearby ordered him. Where? Luke said. Wheres my class? The boy didnt hear him. Luke thought about asking again, louder, but the boy seemed to be some sort of guard, someone in charge, like a policeman. Like the Population Police. Luke put his hand over his mouth and veered away down another hall. Another bell rang and boys started running, desperate to get into their classrooms. Hopelessly, Luke followed a group of three or four through a doorway into another classroom. At least, he thought it was another classroom. For all he knew, he might have circled around and gone into the same one all over again. Maybe that was good. Maybe after class this time, he could make it up to talk to the teacher— It was a short, fat man who stood up to talk this time. As confused and panicky as Luke felt, even he could tell it wasnt the same teacher. Luke hastily sat down, terrified of drawing attention to himself again. He resolved to listen carefully this time, to pay attention and learn. He owed it to everyone—to Mother and Dad, to Jens father, even to Jen herself. It was ten minutes before he realized that the man at the front was speaking some other language, one Luke had never heard before and didnt have a prayer of understanding. Four When the bell rang after this class, Luke didnt even try to go against the crowd. This time the flow of traffic carried him to a huge room with tables instead of desks, and bookshelves instead of portraits on the wall. All the other boys sat down and pulled out books and paper and pens or pencils. Homework. They were doing homework Luke felt brilliant for figuring that out. How many times had he watched his older brothers groan over math problems, stumble over reading assignments, scratch out answers in history workbooks? Matthew and Mark did not like school. Once, years ago, Luke had been peering over Marks shoulder at his homework, and noticed an easy mistake. Isnt eight times four thirty-two? hed innocently asked. You wrote down thirty-four. Mark stuck out his tongue and pushed so hard on his pencil that the lead broke. See what you made me do? he complained. If youre so smart, why dont you go to school for me? Mother was hovering over them. Hush, she said to Mark, and that had been the end of it. Lukes family didnt dwell on what they all knew: Because Luke was the third born, he was illegal, violating the Population Law with every breath he took and every bite of food he ate. Of course he couldnt go to school, or anywhere else. But here he was, now, at school. And it wasnt Matthew and Marks little country school, but a grand, fancy place that only the richest people, Barons, could afford. Rich people like the real Lee Grant, who had died in a skiing accident. His family had concealed his death and secretly given his identity card to help a shadow child come out of hiding. Couldnt everyone tell that Luke was an impostor? Luke wished the real Lee Grant were still alive. He wished that he, himself, were still at home, hiding. Young man, someone said in a warning voice. Luke glanced around. He was the only one still standing. Quickly he slipped into the nearest vacant chair. He didnt have any books to study or work to do. Maybe this was the time to read the note from Jens dad. But as he reached into his pocket he knew it wasnt safe. The boy across the table from him kept looking up, the boy two chairs down kept whispering and pointing. Though Luke kept his head down, he could feel eyes all around him. Even if no one was looking directly at him, Luke felt itchy and anxious just being in the same room with so many other people. He couldnt read the note. He could barely keep himself from bolting out of his chair, running out the door, finding some closet or small space to hide in. And then everybody would know that he wasnt really Lee Grant.'

const midad = 'Everybody would know that all he knew was how to hide. Luke forced himself to sit still for two hours. When a bell went off again, everyone trouped down a hall to a huge dining area. Luke hadnt eaten since breakfast at home—his mothers lightest biscuits and, as a miraculous farewell treat, fresh eggs. Luke could remember the pride shining in her eyes. as she had slid the plate in front of him. From the factory? he had asked. Eggs usually were not available for ordinary people, but his mother worked at a chicken factory, and if her supervisOrs, were in a good mood, s~fnetimes she got extra food. Mother had. nodded. I promised them forty hours of overtime in exchange. Unpaid. Luke had gulped. Just for two eggs for me? Mother had looked at him. It was a good trade, shed said. Remembering breakfast gave him a lump in his throat as big as an egg. He wasnt hungry But he sat down, because all the other boys were sitting. Instantly another boy turned on him and glared. Seniors only, he said. Huh? Luke asked. Only seniors are allowed at this table, the boy said, in the same kind of mocking voice that Mark always used with Luke when Luke had said something dumb. Oh, Luke said. What are you, some kind of a lecker? another boy asked. Luke didnt know how to answer that. He was so eager to get up, he tripped and crashed into the next table. Juniors only, a boy said there. Luke tried to swallow the lump in his throat, but it had grown even bigger. He went from table to table, not even bothering to try to sit- down. At each table, someone said in a bored voice, Sophomores only, or Freshmen only, or Eights only... Luke didnt know what he was, so he kept moving. Finally he reached an empty table and sat down. A bowl of leaves and what looked like germinating soybeans sat in front of him. Was this supposed to be food? The other boys were eating it, so he did, too. The leaves were clammy and bitter and stuck in his throat. Luke let himself think about potato chips. Nobody was supposed to have junk food, because of the food shortages that led to the Population Law. But Jen had given him potato chips when hed gone over to her house, secretly, at great risk. He could still taste the salt, could still feel the crisp chips against the roof of his mouth, could still hear Jen saying, when he protested that potato chips were illegal, Yeah, well, were illegal, too, so why dont we enjoy ourselves? Jen. If Jen were here now, she wouldnt put up with bitter leaves and tasteless bean sprouts for supper. Shed be standing up, demanding decent food. Shed go to any table she wanted. Shed march up to the person in charge—the headmaster?—and say, Why wont anyone tell me what classes to go to? What are demerits? What are the rules, anyway? Youre not running this school very well Shed punch Rolly right in the eye. But Jen wasnt there. Jen was dead. Luke bent his head low over his food. He stopped even pretending to chew and swallow. After supper everyone was herded into another vast room. A man stood at the front talking about how glorious the Government was, about how their leaders wisdom had kept them all from starving. Lies, Luke thought, and marveled that he had the will even to think that. Finally another bell rang and the other boys scattered. Luke walked uncertainly up and down strange halls. To your room, a man warned him. Lights out in ten minutes. Luke was so eager to get to his room, he actually found his voice. I-Im new. I dont know where my room is. Well, then, find out. How? Luke asked. The man sighed, and rolled his eyes. Whats your name? he asked, slowly, as though Luke might be too stupid to understand the question. L— Somehow Luke couldnt bring himself to claim his fake identity. I know my room number. One fifty-six. I just dont remember where it is. Why didnt you say so? the man growled. Up those stairs and around the corner. Even with the mans directions, Luke got turned around and had to search and search. By the time he finally saw the engraved 156, his legs were trembling with exhaustion and his feet were blistered from walking in the stiff, unfamiliar shoes. Luke was used to going barefoot He was used to sitting in the house all day, not walking up and down stairs and through labyrinth-like halls. He stepped through the doorway and headed straight for his bed. It had a spread on it and looked like all the others now. All Luke wanted to do was fall into it and go to sleep and forget everything that had happened that day. Did you ask permission? someone barked at him. Luke looked around. He was so tired, he hadnt even noticed that seven boys were sitting on the floor in a circle, playing some sort of card game. Per-Permission? he asked. One of the boys—probably the one whod spoken— threw back his head and laughed. He was tall and thin, and older than Luke. Maybe even as old as Lukes brother Matthew, who was fifteen. But Matthew was familiar, known. Luke couldnt read this boys expression. He had a strange cast to his dark eyes, and his face was oddly shaped. Something about him reminded Luke of the pictures hed seen in books of jackals. Hey the boy said. They sent us a voice replicator. Amazingly human-like form. Voice is a little off, though. Lets try another one. Repeat after me: I am an exnay I am a fonrol. I am a lecker. I dont deserve to live. Most of the other boys were laughing now, too, but quietly, as if they didnt want to miss Lukes answer. Luke hesitated. Hed heard those words before: Rolly had called him an exnay and a fonrol, and someone had called him a lecker at dinner. Maybe they were from that foreign language the short, fat teacher had been speaking. Luke had no idea what the words meant, but he could tell that they were probably bad things. Thanks to Matthew and Mark, he could spot a setup. Luke shook his head. The jackal boy sighed in exaggerated disappointment. Broken already, he said. He stood up and knocked his fist against Lukes side the way Luke had seen his father tap on the engine of broken tractors or trucks. You just cant get good junk nowadays. Luke pulled away He stepped toward his bed. Jackal boy laughed again. Oh, no, not so fast. Permission, remember?. Say, I am your servant. 0 mighty master. I shall do your bidding forever. I will not eat or sleep or breathe unless you say it is to be ~ The boy moved between Luke and his bed. The others leaned forward, menacingly. Like a pack of jackals, Luke thought. Jackals were nasty, vicious animals. Luke had read a book about them. They tore their prey limb from limb sometimes. These were really boys, not jackals, Luke reminded himself. But he was too tired to fight. I am your servant, he mumbled. I—I dont remember the rest. Why do they always send us the stupid ones? the jackal boy asked. He looked down at Luke. Bet you dont even know your own name. L-Lee, Luke whispered, looking down at his shoes. Lee, repeat after me. I— I—— Am— Am— The jackal boy fed him each word and Luke, hating himself, repeated it. Then the boy made him touch his elbow to his nose. Cross his eyes. Stand on one foot while reciting, I am the lowest of the low. Everyone should spit on me, five times. The lights flickered and went out in the middle of this ordeal, and still the jackal boy continued. Finally he yawned. Luke could hear his jaw crack in the dark. New boy, you bore me, he said. Remove yourself from my presence. Huh? Luke said. Go to bed Meekly, Luke slipped beneath his covers. He was still wearing his clothes—even his shoes—but he didnt dare get back up to take them off The unfamiliar pants bunched up around his waist, and he silently smoothed them out. Touching his pocket reminded him: He still hadnt read the note from Jens dad. Tomorrow, Luke thought. He felt a little bit of hope return. Tomorrow he would read the note, and then he would know how to find out what classes to go to, how to deal with boys like Rolly and his roommates, how to get by. No—not just to get by. Luke remembered what hed hoped for, leaving home—was it only that morning? It seemed so long ago. Hed been thinking about making a difference in the world, finding some way to help other third children who had to hide. Luke didnt expect the note from Jens dad to tell him how to do that, but it would give him a start. It would make that possible. All he had to do was go to sleep and then it would be tomorrow and he could read the note. But Luke couldnt sleep. The room was filled with unfamiliar sounds: first the other boys whispering, then breathing deeply, in sleep. The beds creaking when someone turned over. Some vent somewhere blowing air on them all. Luke ached, missing his room at home, his family, Jen. And his own name. He felt his lips draw together. Luke, he whispered soundlessly, in the dark. My name is Luke. He waited silently, his heart pounding, but nothing happened. No alarm bells went off, no Population Police swooped in to carry him away. His feeling of hope surged, even more than the fear. His name was Luke. He was nobodys servant. He was not the lowest of the low. He was Dad and Mothers son. He was Matthew and Marks brother. He was Jens friend. Or—he had been. Five Luke didnt get a chance to read the note from Jens dad the next day. Or the next. Or the next. In fact, an entire week went by with him resolving every night in bed, Tomorrow Surely Ill find a way to read the note tomorrow. But the next nightfall found him still stymied. At first, he thought there was an easy solution. The bathroom, for example. He could go in, shut the door, read the note. But none of the bathrooms at Hendricks were like the bathroom at home, closed-in and private. The Hendricks bathrooms were rows of urinals and commodes, right out in front of everyone. Even the shower was communal, just an open, tiled room with dozens of spigots sprouting from each wall. Luke could barely bring himself to lower his pants with everyone watching, let alone read the note. He always lingered until most of the other boys were gone, but he never found a bathroom that fully emptied out Finally, after three days had passed and he was getting desperate, he resolved to wait in the bathroom for as long as it took, regardless of bells or classes. The bell rang for breakfast and still he remained, pretending to be very concerned with scrubbing his face. Finally it was just Luke and another boy, standing by the door. Out, the boy said. The boy was mean-faced and muscular. Lukes legs trembled, but he didnt shut off the water. Im not done, Luke mumbled, trying to sound nonchalant, unconcerned. He failed miserably The boy grabbed Lukes arm. Didnt you hear me? I said OUT The boy jerked so hard on Lukes arm that Luke felt pain shoot through his whole body. Then the boy shoved Luke out the door. Luke landed in a heap on the hallway floor. A hall monitor looked down at him in disgust Youre late for breakfast, he said. Two demerits. Luke feebly looked from the hall monitor to the other boy, who was now standing menacingly in the bathroom doorway. Then he understood: They were alike. There were guards in all the bathrooms, as well as in all the halls. He couldnt read the note in either place. He wondered about trying to read the note in his room. He would get there first at bedtime, he decided. The first several days this was impossible because, no matter how hard he tried, he couldnt ever remember which way to go. Left at the top of the stairs, then right, then right, then left? Or was it right, then left, then left, then right? Most nights, it was a miracle if he found the room at all before lights out Though that was just as well, because it reduced the amount of time that jackal boy could spend tormenting him. Finally, in the middle of Lukes second week at Hendricks, he sat at the back of the hall during .the evening lecture, so he was the first one up the stairs. Holding his breath, he counted off the turns. Right—yes. Right—yes. Left. And there—yes Room 156. Luke rushed in past the ball monitor. He slipped behind the door, out of sight, and jammed his hand in his pocket And heard, So my servants reporting for duty early tonight, eh? It was jackal boy, lounging on his bed. Luke had to bite his lip to keep from screaming. That night jackal boy was crueler than ever. Luke had to repeat, I am a fonrol, fifty times. He had to hop up and down on one foot for five minutes. He had to do one hundred push-ups. (Hed never seen anyone do a push-up before. All the other boys howled with laughter when he stammeringly confessed, I—I dont know how.) He had to push a marble across the floor with his nose. Lying in bed that night, Luke despaired. His shoulders ached from the push-ups; his side was still bruised from being thrown out of the bathroom. Ill never get to read the not4 he thought Ill never be alone It wasnt just that he wanted to read the note. It was maddening to always be around other people, to know that his every action might be observed, to never have a second of privacy. How could he long to be alone, and feel so lonely, all at once? Six Luke got by. It wasnt really that hard, as long as he didnt let himself want anything. As long as he didnt linger in the bathroom or halls, as long as he sat down promptly when he entered a classroom, as long as he didnt try to eat at the wrong table, nobody bothered him except jackal boy. And jackal boys torture was bearable, even at its worst The problem was, Luke couldnt always stop himself from wanting more. He wanted home and he wanted his family and he wanted Jen alive again. And he wanted all the third children to be free, so he didnt have to go around pretending to be someone else anymore. Those were impossible dreams, little fantasies that he played with in his mind in the middle of the night when he couldnt sleep. The glow of those fantasies always made reality seem even bleaker the next morning. But everything else he wanted seemed impossible, too. He wanted to be able to climb into bed each night without even looking at jackal boy—without saying, I am the dumbest lecker alive, a hundred times, without doing a single push-up, pull-up, sit-up, or toe-touch. Once during a nightly session, he dared to mumble, Leave me alone, to jackal boy. But when Luke looked up, jackal boy was laughing hysterically. Did you—did you say what I thought—you said? he sputtered between laughs. Leave me alone. Oh, thats a good one, you stupid fonrol. You going to make me? Go ahead. Make me. Jackal boy had his fists up, a taunting grin smeared across his face. Behind him, their other roommates gathered, eager for a fight. Eager, it seemed, to help jackal boy pound every shred of courage out of Luke. Luke sized up the height and weight difference just between him and jackal boy. Never mind the rest of The road curved away from the school. They followed it past familiar houses. Then, just beyond a small wooded area, they stopped and looked up a sloping lawn, the grass uncut for weeks, tall weeds poking out everywhere, the shrubs ragged and overgrown. At the top of the lawn, nearly hidden in the shadows of enormous old oak trees, sprawled a large ramshackle house. The house, anyone could see, had once been grand. It was gray shingled, three stories tall, with a wraparound screened porch, a sloping red roof, and tall chimneys on either end. But the broken windows on the second floor, the cracked, weather-stained shingles, the bare spots on the roof, and the shutters hanging loosely beside the dust-smeared windows were evidence of the houses neglect. Everyone in Pitts Landing knew it as the Coffman house. Coffman was the name painted on the mailbox that tilted on its broken pole over the front walk. But the house had been deserted for years—ever since Greg and his friends could remember. And people liked to tell weird stories about the house: ghost stories and wild tales about murders and ghastly things that happened there. Most likely, none of them were true. Hey—I know what we can do for excitement, Michael said, staring up at the house bathed in shadows. Huh? What are you talking about? Greg asked warily. Lets go into the Coffman house, Michael said, starting to make his way across the weed-choked lawn. Whoa. Are you crazy? Greg called, hurrying to catch up to him. Lets go in, Michael said, his blue eyes catching the light of the late afternoon sun filtering down through the tall oak trees. We wanted an adventure. Something a little exciting, right? Come on—lets check it out. Greg hesitated and stared up at the house. A cold chill ran down his back. Before he could reply, a dark form leaped up from the shadows of the tall weeds and attacked him 5 2 Greg toppled backward onto the ground. Aah he screamed. Then he realized the others were laughing. Its that dumb cocker spaniel Shari cried. He followed us Go home, dog. Go home Bird shooed the dog away. The dog trotted to the curb, turned around, and stared back at them, its stubby tail wagging furiously. Feeling embarrassed that hed become so frightened, Greg slowly pulled himself to his feet, expecting his friends to give him grief. But they were staring up at the Coffman house thoughtfully. Yeah, Michaels right, Bird said, slapping Michael hard on the back, so hard Michael winced and turned to slug Bird. Lets see what its like in there. No way, Greg said, hanging back. I mean, the place is kind of creepy, dont you think? So? Shari challenged him, joining Michael and Bird, who repeated her question: So? So  I dont know, Greg replied. He didnt like being the sensible one of the group. Everyone always made fun of the sensible one. Hed rather be the wild and crazy one. But somehow he always ended up sensible. I dont think we should go in there, he said, staring up at the neglected old house. Are you chicken? Bird asked. Chicken Michael joined in. Bird began to cluck loudly, tucking his hands into his armpits and flapping his arms. With his beady eyes and beaky nose, he looked just like a chicken. Greg didnt want to laugh, but he couldnt help it. Bird always made him laugh. The clucking and flapping seemed to end the discussion. They were standing at the foot of the broken concrete steps that led up to the screened porch. Look. The window next to the front door is broken, Shari said. We can just reach in and open the door. This is cool, Michael said enthusiastically. Are we really doing this? Greg, being the sensible one, had to ask. I mean— what about Spidey? Spidey was a weird-looking man of fifty or sixty theyd all seen lurking about town. He dressed entirely in black and crept along on long, slender legs. He looked just like a black spider, so the kids all called him Spidey. 6 Most likely he was homeless or a drifter. No one really knew anything about him—where hed come from, where he lived. But a lot of kids had seen him hanging around the Coffman house. Maybe Spidey doesnt like visitors, Greg warned. But Shari was already reaching in through the broken windowpane to unlock the front door. And after little effort, she turned the brass knob and the heavy wooden door swung open. One by one, they stepped into the front entryway, Greg reluctantly bringing up the rear. It was dark inside the house. Only narrow beams of sunlight managed to trickle down through the heavy trees in front, creating pale circles of light on the worn brown carpet at their feet. The floorboards squeaked as Greg and his friends made their way past the living room, which was bare except for a couple of overturned grocery store cartons against one wall. Spideys furniture? Greg wondered. The living room carpet, as threadbare as the one in the entryway, had a dark oval stain in the center of it. Greg and Bird, stopping in the doorway, both noticed it at the same time. Think its blood? Bird asked, his tiny eyes lighting up with excitement. Greg felt a chill on the back of his neck. Probably ketchup, he replied. Bird laughed and slapped him hard on the back. Shari and Michael were exploring the kitchen. They were staring at the dustcovered counter as Greg and Bird stepped up behind them. They saw immediately what had captured their attention. Two fat gray mice were standing on the counter, staring back at Shari and Michael. Theyre cute, Shari said. They look just like cartoon mice. The sound of her voice made the two rodents scamper along the counter, around the sink, and out of sight. Theyre gross, Michael said, making a disgusted face. I think they were rats— not mice. Rats have long tails. Mice dont, Greg told him. They were definitely rats, Bird muttered, pushing past them and into the hallway. He disappeared toward the front of the house. Shari reached up and pulled open a cabinet over the counter. Empty. I guess Spidey never uses the kitchen, she said. Well, I didnt think he was a gourmet chef, Greg joked. He followed her into the long, narrow dining room, as bare and dusty as the other rooms. A low chandelier still hung from the ceiling, so brown with caked dust it was impossible to tell that it was glass. Looks like a haunted house, Greg said softly. Boo, Shari replied. Theres not much to see in here, Greg complained, following her back to the dark hallway. Unless you get a thrill from dustballs. Suddenly, a loud crack made him jump. Shari laughed and squeezed his shoulder. 7 What was that? he cried, unable to stifle his fear. Old houses do things like that, she said. They make noises for no reason at all. I think we should leave, Greg insisted, embarrassed again that hed acted so frightened. I mean, its boring in here. Its kind of exciting being somewhere were not supposed to be, Shari said, peeking into a dark, empty room—probably a den or study at one time. I guess, Greg replied uncertainly. They bumped into Michael. Wheres Bird? Greg asked. I think he went down to the basement, Michael replied. Huh? The basement? Michael pointed to an open door at the right of the hallway. The stairs are there. The three of them made their way to the top of the stairs.'

const midaf = 'They peered down into the darkness. Bird? From somewhere deep in the basement, his voice floated up to them in a horrified scream: Help Its got me Somebody—please help Its got me 8 3 Its got me Its got me At the sound of Birds terrified cries, Greg pushed past Shari and Michael, who stood frozen in openmouthed horror. Practically flying down the steep stairway, Greg called out to his friend. Im coming, Bird What is it? His heart pounding, Greg stopped at the bottom of the stairs, every muscle tight with fear. His eyes searched frantically through the smoky light pouring in from the basement windows up near the ceiling. Bird? There he was, sitting comfortably, calmly, on an overturned metal trash can, his legs crossed, a broad smile on his birdlike face. Gotcha, he said softly, and burst out laughing. What is it? What happened? came the frightened voices of Shari and Michael. They clamored down the stairs, coming to a stop beside Greg. It took them only a few seconds to scope out the situation. Another dumb joke? Michael asked, his voice still trembling with fear. Bird—were you goofing on us again? Shari asked, shaking her head. Enjoying his moment, Bird nodded, with his peculiar half grin. You guys are too easy, he scoffed. But, Doug— Shari started. She only called him Doug when she was upset with him. Havent you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf? What if something bad happens sometime, and you really need help, and we think youre just goofing? What could happen? Bird replied smugly. He stood up and gestured around the basement. Look—its brighter down here than upstairs. He was right. Sunlight from the backyard cascaded down through four long windows at ground level, near the ceiling of the basement. I still think we should get out of here, Greg insisted, his eyes moving quickly around the large, cluttered room. Behind Birds overturned trash can stood an improvised table made out of a sheet of plywood resting on four paint cans. A nearly flat mattress, dirty and stained, rested against the wall, a faded wool blanket folded at the foot. Spidey must live down here Michael exclaimed. Bird kicked his way through a pile of empty food boxes that had been tossed all over the floor—TV dinners, mostly. Hey, a Hungry Man dinner he exclaimed. Where does Spidey heat these up? Maybe he eats them frozen, Shari suggested. You know. Like Popsicles. She made her way toward a towering oak wardrobe and pulled open the doors. Wow This is excellent she declared. Look She pulled out a ratty-looking fur 9 coat and wrapped it around her shoulders. Excellent she repeated, twirling in the old coat. From across the room, Greg could see that the wardrobe was stuffed with old clothing. Michael and Bird hurried to join Shari and began pulling out strangelooking pairs of bell-bottom pants, yellowed dress shirts with pleats down the front, tie-dyed neckties that were about a foot wide, and bright-colored scarves and bandannas. Hey, guys— Greg warned. Dont you think maybe those belong to somebody? Bird spun around, a fuzzy red boa wrapped around his neck and shoulders. Yeah. These are Spideys dress-up clothes, he cracked. Check out this baad hat, Shari said, turning around to show off the bright purple wide-brimmed hat she had pulled on. Neat, Michael said, examining a long blue cape. This stuff must be at least twenty-five years old. Its awesome. How could someone just leave it here? Maybe theyre coming back for it, Greg suggested. As his friends explored the contents of the wardrobe, Greg wandered to the other end of the large basement. A furnace occupied the far wall, its ducts covered in thick cobwebs. Partially hidden by the furnace ducts, Greg could see stairs, probably leading to an outside exit. Wooden shelves lined the adjoining wall, cluttered with old paint cans, rags, newspapers, and rusty tools. Whoever lived here must have been a real handyman, Greg thought, examining a wooden worktable in front of the shelves. A metal vise was clamped to the edge of the worktable. Greg turned the handle, expecting the jaws of the vise to open.Thomas refused. Some instinct took over his actions and without saying anything he  turned away from Alby and walked to a nearby tree, where he plopped down to sit with his  back against the rough bark. Panic swelled inside him once again, almost too much to bear.  But he took a deep breath and forced himself to try to accept the situation. Just go with it,  he thought. You wont figure out anything if you give in to fear. Then tell me, Thomas called out, struggling to keep his voice even. Tell me the long  story. Alby glanced at the friends closest to him, rolling his eyes, and Thomas studied the crowd   again. His original estimate had been close — there were probably fifty to sixty of them,  ranging from boys in their midteens to young adults like Alby, who seemed to be one of the  oldest. At that moment, Thomas realized with a sickening lurch that he had no idea how  old he was. His heart sank at the thought — he was so lost he didnt even know his own age. Seriously, he said, giving up on the show of courage. Where am I? Alby walked over to him and sat down cross-legged; the crowd of boys followed and  packed in behind. Heads popped up here and there, kids leaning in every direction to get a  better look. If you aint scared, Alby said, you aint human. Act any different and Id throw you off  the Cliff because itd mean youre a psycho.  The Cliff? Thomas asked, blood draining from his face. Shuck it, Alby said, rubbing his eyes. Aint no way to start these conversations, you get  me? We dont kill shanks like you here, I promise. Just try and avoid being killed, survive,  whatever. He paused, and Thomas realized his face mustve whitened even more when he heard  that last part. Man, Alby said, then ran his hands over his short hair as he let out a long sigh. I aint  good at this — youre the first Greenbean since Nick was killed. Thomass eyes widened, and another boy stepped up and playfully slapped Alby across  the head. Wait for the bloody Tour, Alby, he said, his voice thick with an odd accent.  Kids gonna have a buggin heart attack, nothin even been heard yet. He bent down and  extended his hand toward Thomas. Names Newt, Greenie, and wed all be right cheery if  yad forgive our klunk-for-brains new leader, here. Thomas reached out and shook the boys hand — he seemed a lot nicer than Alby. Newt  was taller than Alby too, but looked to be a year or so younger. His hair was blond and cut  long, cascading over his T-shirt. Veins stuck out of his muscled arms. Pipe it, shuck-face, Alby grunted, pulling Newt down to sit next to him. At least he can  understand half my words. There were a few scattered laughs, and then everyone gathered  behind Alby and Newt, packing in even tighter, waiting to hear what they said. Alby spread his arms out, palms up. This place is called the Glade, all right? Its where  we live, where we eat, where we sleep — we call ourselves the Gladers. Thats all you —  Who sent me here? Thomas demanded, fear finally giving way to anger. Howd —  But Albys hand shot out before he could finish, grabbing Thomas by the shirt as he  leaned forward on his knees. Get up, shank, get up Alby stood, pulling Thomas with him. Thomas finally got his feet under him, scared all over again. He backed against the tree,  trying to get away from Alby, who stayed right in his face. No interruptions, boy Alby shouted. Whacker, if we told you everything, youd die on  the spot, right after you klunked your pants. Baggersd drag you off, and you aint no good  to us then, are ya? I dont even know what youre talking about, Thomas said slowly, shocked at how  steady his voice sounded. Newt reached out and grabbed Alby by the shoulders. Alby, lay off a bit. Youre hurtin  more than help in, ya know? Alby let go of Thomass shirt and stepped back, his chest heaving with breaths. Aint got   time to be nice, Greenbean. Old lifes over, new lifes begun. Learn the rules quick, listen,  dont talk. You get me? Thomas looked over at Newt, hoping for help. Everything inside him churned and hurt;  the tears that had yet to come burned his eyes. Newt nodded. Greenie, you get him, right? He nodded again. Thomas fumed, wanted to punch somebody. But he simply said, Yeah. Good that, Alby said. First Day. Thats what today is for you, shank. Nights comin,  Runnersll be back soon. The Box came late today, aint got time for the Tour. Tomorrow  morning, right after the wake-up. He turned toward Newt. Get him a bed, get him to  sleep. Good that, Newt said. Albys eyes returned to Thomas, narrowing. A few weeks, youll be happy, shank. Youll  be happy and helpin. None of us knew jack on First Day, you neither. New life begins  tomorrow. Alby turned and pushed his way through the crowd, then headed for the slanted wooden  building in the corner. Most of the kids wandered away then, each one giving Thomas a  lingering look before they walked off. Thomas folded his arms, closed his eyes, took a deep breath. Emptiness ate away at his  insides, quickly replaced by a sadness that hurt his heart. It was all too much — where was  he? What was this place? Was it some kind of prison? If so, why had he been sent here,  and for how long? The language was odd, and none of the boys seemed to care whether he  lived or died. Tears threatened again to fill his eyes, but he refused to let them come. What did I do? he whispered, not really meaning for anyone to hear him. What did I  do — whyd they send me here? Newt clapped him on the shoulder. Greenie, what youre feelin, weve all felt it. Weve  all had First Day, come out of that dark box. Things are bad, they are, and theyll get much  worse for ya soon, thats the truth. But down the road a piece, youll be fightin true and  good. I can tell youre not a bloody sissy. Is this a prison? Thomas asked; he dug in the darkness of his thoughts, trying to find a  crack to his past. Done asked four questions, havent ya? Newt replied. No good answers for ya, not yet,  anyway. Best be quiet now, accept the change — morn comes tomorrow. Thomas said nothing, his head sunk, his eyes staring at the cracked, rocky ground. A line  of small-leafed weeds ran along the edge of one of the stone blocks, tiny yellow flowers  peeping through as if searching for the sun, long disappeared behind the enormous walls of  the Glade. Chuckll be a good fit for ya, Newt said. Wee little fat shank, but nice sap when alls  said and done. Stay here, Ill be back. Newt had barely finished his sentence when a sudden, piercing scream ripped through  the air. High and shrill, the barely human shriek echoed across the stone courtyard; every  kid in sight turned to look toward the source. Thomas felt his blood turn to icy slush as he  realized that the horrible sound came from the wooden building. Even Newt had jumped as if startled, his forehead creasing in concern. Shuck it, he said. Cant the bloody Med-jacks handle that boy for ten minutes without   needin my help? He shook his head and lightly kicked Thomas on the foot. Find Chuckie,  tell him hes in charge of your sleepin arrangements. And then he turned and headed in  the direction of the building, running. Thomas slid down the rough face of the tree until he sat on the ground again; he shrank  back against the bark and closed his eyes, wishing he could wake up from this terrible,  terrible dream.   CHAPTER 3   Thomas sat there for several moments, too overwhelmed to move. He finally forced himself  to look over at the haggard building. A group of boys milled around outside, glancing  anxiously at the upper windows as if expecting a hideous beast to leap out in an explosion  of glass and wood. A metallic clicking sound from the branches above grabbed his attention, made him look  up; a flash of silver and red light caught his eyes just before disappearing around the trunk  to the other side. He scrambled to his feet and walked around the tree, craning his neck for  a sign of whatever hed heard, but he saw only bare branches, gray and brown, forking out  like skeleton fingers — and looking just as alive. That was one of them beetle blades, someone said. Thomas turned to his right to see a kid standing nearby, short and pudgy, staring at him.  He was young — probably the youngest of any in the group hed seen so far, maybe twelve  or thirteen years old. His brown hair hung down over his ears and neck, scraping the tops  of his shoulders. Blue eyes shone through an otherwise pitiful face, flabby and flushed. Thomas nodded at him. A beetle what? Beetle blade, the boy said, pointing to the top of the tree. Wont hurt ya unless youre  stupid enough to touch one of them. He paused. Shank. He didnt sound comfortable  saying the last word, as if he hadnt quite grasped the slang of the Glade. Another scream, this one long and nerve-grinding, tore through the air and Thomass  heart lurched. The fear was like icy dew on his skin. Whats going on over there? he  asked, pointing at the building. Dont know, the chubby boy replied; his voice still carried the high pitch of childhood.  Bens in there, sicker than a dog. They got him. They? Thomas didnt like the malicious way the boy had said the word. Yeah. Who are They? Better hope you never find out, the kid answered, looking far too comfortable for the  situation. He held out his hand. My names Chuck. I was the Greenbean until you showed  up. This is my guide for the night? Thomas thought. He couldnt shake his extreme discomfort,  and now annoyance crept in as well. Nothing made sense; his head hurt. Why is everyone calling me Greenbean? he asked, shaking Chucks hand quickly, then  letting go. Cuz youre the newest Newbie. Chuck pointed at Thomas and laughed. Another scream  came from the house, a sound like a starving animal being tortured. How can you be laughing? Thomas asked, horrified by the noise. It sounds like  someones dying in there. Hell be okay. No one dies if they make it back in time to get the Serum. Its all or  nothing. Dead or not dead. Just hurts a lot.'

const midag = 'This gave Thomas pause. What hurts a lot? Chucks eyes wandered as if he wasnt sure what to say. Urn, gettin stung by the  Grievers. Grievers? Thomas was only getting more and more confused. Stung. Grievers. The words  had a heavy weight of dread to them, and he suddenly wasnt so sure he wanted to know  what Chuck was talking about. Chuck shrugged, then looked away, eyes rolling. Thomas sighed in frustration and leaned back against the tree. Looks like you barely  know more than I do, he said, but he knew it wasnt true. His memory loss was strange.  He mostly remembered the workings of the world — but emptied of specifics, faces, names.  Like a book completely intact but missing one word in every dozen, making it a miserable  and confusing read. He didnt even know his age. Chuck, how ... old do you think I am? The boy scanned him up and down. Id say youre sixteen. And in case you were  wondering, five foot nine ... brown hair. Oh, and ugly as fried liver on a stick. He snorted  a laugh. Thomas was so stunned hed barely heard the last part. Sixteen? He was sixteen? He felt  much older than that. Are you serious? He paused, searching for words. How ... He didnt even know what  to ask. Dont worry. Youll be all whacked for a few days, but then youll get used to this place.  I have. We live here, this is it. Better than living in a pile of klunk. He squinted, maybe  anticipating Thomass question. Klunks another word for poo. Poo makes a klunk sound  when it falls in our pee pots. Thomas looked at Chuck, unable to believe he was having this conversation. Thats  nice was all he could manage. He stood up and walked past Chuck toward the old  building; shack was a better word for the place. It looked three or four stories high and  about to fall down at any minute — a crazy assortment of logs and boards and thick twine  and windows seemingly thrown together at random, the massive, ivy-strewn stone walls  rising up behind it. As he moved across the courtyard, the distinct smell of firewood and  some kind of meat cooking made his stomach grumble. Knowing now that it was just a sick  kid doing the screaming made Thomas feel better. Until he thought about what had caused  it ... Whats your name? Chuck asked from behind, running to catch up.  What? Your name? You still havent told us — and I know you remember that much. Thomas. He barely heard himself say it — his thoughts had spun in a new direction. If  Chuck was right, hed just discovered a link to the rest of the boys. A common pattern to  their memory losses. They all remembered their names. Why not their parents names?  Why not a friends name? Why not their last names? Nice to meet you, Thomas, Chuck said. Dont you worry, Ill take care of you. Ive been  here a whole month, and I know the place inside and out. You can count on Chuck, okay? Thomas had almost reached the front door of the shack and the small group of boys  congregating there when he was hit by a sudden and surprise rush of anger. He turned to   face Chuck. You cant even tell me anything. I wouldnt call that taking care of me. He  turned back toward the door, intent on going inside to find some answers. Where this  sudden courage and resolve came from, he had no idea. Chuck shrugged. Nothin I say 11 do you any good, he said. Im basically still a Newbie,  too. But I can be your friend —  I dont need friends, Thomas interrupted. Hed reached the door, an ugly slab of sun-faded wood, and he pulled it open to see  several stoic-faced boys standing at the foot of a crooked staircase, the steps and railings  twisted and angled in all directions. Dark wallpaper covered the walls of the foyer and  hallway, half of it peeling off. The only decorations in sight were a dusty vase on a three-  legged table and a black-and-white picture of an ancient woman dressed in an old-  fashioned white dress. It reminded Thomas of a haunted house from a movie or something.  There were even planks of wood missing from the floor. The place reeked of dust and mildew — a big contrast to the pleasant smells outside.  Flickering fluorescent lights shone from the ceiling. He hadnt thought of it yet, but he had  to wonder where the electricity came from in a place like the Glade. He stared at the old  woman in the picture. Had she lived here once? Taken care of these people? Hey, look, its the Greenbean, one of the older boys called out. With a start, Thomas  realized it was the black -haired guy whod given him the look of death earlier. He looked  like he was fifteen or so, tall and skinny. His nose was the size of a small fist and resembled  a deformed potato. This shank probably klunked his pants when he heard old Benny baby  scream like a girl. Need a new diaper, shuck-face? My names Thomas. He had to get away from this guy. Without another word, he made  for the stairs, only because they were close, only because he had no idea what to do or say.  But the bully stepped in front of him, holding a hand up. Hold on there, Greenie. He jerked a thumb in the direction of the upper floor. Newbies  arent allowed to see someone whos been ... taken. Newt and Alby wont allow it. Whats your problem? Thomas asked, trying to keep the fear out of his voice, trying not  to think what the kid had meant by taken. I dont even know where I am. All I want is  some help. Listen to me, Greenbean. The boy wrinkled up his face, folded his arms. Ive seen you  before. Somethings fishy about you showing up here, and Im gonna find out what. A surge of heat pulsed through Thomass veins. Ive never seen you before in my life. I  have no idea who you are, and I couldnt care less, he spat. But really, how would he  know? And how could this kid remember him? The bully snickered, a short burst of laughter mixed with a phlegm-filled snort. Then his  face grew serious, his eyebrows slanting inward. Ive ... seen you, shank. Not too many in  these parts can say theyve been stung. He pointed up the stairs. I have. I know what old  Benny babys going through. Ive been there. And I saw you during the Changing. He reached out and poked Thomas in the chest. And I bet your first meal from Frypan  that Benny 11 say hes seen ya, too. Thomas refused to break eye contact but decided to say nothing. Panic ate at him once  again. Would things ever stop getting worse? Griever got ya wettin yourself? the boy said through a sneer. A little scared now?   Dont wanna get stung, do ya? There was that word again. Stung. Thomas tried not to think about it and pointed up the  stairs, from where the moans of the sick kid echoed through the building. If Newt went up  there, then I wanna talk to him. The boy said nothing, stared at Thomas for several seconds. Then he shook his head.  You know what? Youre right, Tommy — I shouldnt be so mean to Newbies. Go on upstairs  and Im sure Alby and Newtll fill you in. Seriously, go on. Im sorry. He lightly slapped Thomass shoulder, then stepped back, gesturing up the stairs. But  Thomas knew the kid was up to something. Losing parts of your memory didnt make you  an idiot. Whats your name? Thomas asked, stalling for time while he tried to decide if he should  go up after all. Gaily. And dont let anyone fool you. Im the real leader here, not the two geezer shanks  upstairs. Me. You can call me Captain Gaily if you want. He smiled for the first time; his  teeth matched his disgusting nose. Two or three were missing, and not a single one  approached anything close to the color white. His breath escaped just enough for Thomas  to get a whiff, reminding him of some horrible memory that was just out of reach. It made  his stomach turn. Okay, he said, so sick of the guy he wanted to scream, punch him in the face. Captain  Gaily it is. He exaggerated a salute, feeling a rush of adrenaline, as he knew hed just  crossed a line. A few snickers escaped the crowd, and Gaily looked around, his face bright red. He  peered back at Thomas, hatred furrowing his brow and crinkling his monstrous nose. Just go up the stairs, Gaily said. And stay away from me, you little slinthead. He  pointed up again but didnt take his eyes off Thomas. Fine. Thomas looked around one more time, embarrassed, confused, angry. He felt the  heat of blood in his face. No one made a move to stop him from doing as Gaily asked,  except for Chuck, who stood at the front door, shaking his head. Youre not supposed to, the younger boy said. Youre a Newbie — you cant go up  there. Go, said Gaily with a sneer. Go on up. Thomas regretted having come inside in the first place — but he did want to talk to that  Newt guy. He started up the stairs. Each step groaned and creaked under his weight; he mightve  stopped for fear of falling through the old wood if he werent leaving such an awkward  situation below. Up he went, wincing at every splintered sound. The stairs reached a  landing, turned left, then came upon a railed hallway leading to several rooms. Only one  door had a light coming through the crack at the bottom. The Changing Gaily shouted from below. Look forward to it, shuck-face As if the taunting gave Thomas a sudden burst of courage, he walked over to the lit door,  ignoring the creaking floorboards and laughter downstairs — ignoring the onslaught of  words he didnt understand, suppressing the dreadful feelings they induced. He reached  down, turned the brass handle, and opened the door. Inside the room, Newt and Alby crouched over someone lying on a bed.   Thomas leaned in closer to see what the fuss was all about, but when he got a clear look  at the condition of the patient, his heart went cold. He had to fight the bile that surged up  his throat. The look was fast — only a few seconds — but it was enough to haunt him forever. A  twisted, pale figure writhing in agony, chest bare and hideous. Tight, rigid cords of sickly  green veins webbed across the boys body and limbs, like ropes under his skin. Purplish  bruises covered the kid, red hives, bloody scratches. His bloodshot eyes bulged, darting back  and forth. The image had already burned into Thomass mind before Alby jumped up,  blocking the view but not the moans and screams, pushing Thomas out of the room, then  slamming the door shut behind them. Whatre you doing up here, Greenie Alby yelled, his lips taut with anger, eyes on fire. Thomas felt weak. I ... uh ... want some answers, he murmured, but he couldnt put  any strength in his words — felt himself give up inside. What was wrong with that kid?  Thomas slouched against the railing in the hallway and stared at the floor, not sure what to  do next. Get your runtcheeks down those stairs, right now, Alby ordered. Chuckll help you. If I  see you again before tomorrow morning, you aint reachin another one alive. Ill throw  you off the Cliff myself, you get me? Thomas was humiliated and scared. He felt like hed shrunk to the size of a small rat.  Without saying a word, he pushed past Alby and headed down the creaky steps, going as  fast as he dared. Ignoring the gaping stares of everyone at the bottom — especially Gaily —  he walked out the door, pulling Chuck by the arm as he did so. Thomas hated these people. He hated all of them. Except Chuck. Get me away from  these guys, Thomas said. He realized that Chuck might actually be his only friend in the  world. You got it, Chuck replied, his voice chipper, as if thrilled to be needed. But first we  should get you some food from Frypan. I dont know if I can ever eat again. Not after what hed just seen. Chuck nodded. Yeah, you will. Ill meet you at the same tree as before. Ten minutes. Thomas was more than happy to get away from the house, and headed back toward the  tree. Hed only known what it was like to be alive here for a short while and he already  wanted it to end. He wished for all the world he could remember something about his  previous life. Anything. His mom, his dad, a friend, his school, a hobby. A girl. He blinked hard several times, trying to get the image of what hed just seen in the shack  out of his mind. The Changing. Gaily had called it the Changing.'

const midal = 'It wasnt cold, but Thomas shuddered once again.   CHAPTER 4   Thomas leaned against the tree as he waited for Chuck. He scanned the compound of the  Glade, this new place of nightmares where he seemed destined to live. The shadows from  the walls had lengthened considerably, already creeping up the sides of the ivy-covered  stone faces on the other side. At least this helped Thomas know directions — the wooden building crouched in the  northwest corner, wedged in a darkening patch of shadow, the grove of trees in the  southwest. The farm area, where a few workers were still picking their way through the  fields, spread across the entire northeast quarter of the Glade. The animals were in the  southeast corner, mooing and crowing and baying. In the exact middle of the courtyard, the still-gaping hole of the Box lay open, as if  inviting him to jump back in and go home. Near that, maybe twenty feet to the south,  stood a squat building made of rough concrete blocks, a menacing iron door its only  entrance — there were no windows. A large round handle resembling a steel steering wheel  marked the only way to open the door, just like something within a submarine. Despite  what hed just seen, Thomas didnt know which he felt more strongly — curiosity to know  what was inside, or dread at finding out. Thomas had just moved his attention to the four vast openings in the middle of the main  walls of the Glade when Chuck arrived, a couple of sandwiches cradled in his arms, along  with apples and two metal cups of water. The sense of relief that flooded through Thomas  surprised him — he wasnt completely alone in this place. Frypan wasnt too happy about me invading his kitchen before suppertime, Chuck said,  sitting down next to the tree, motioning to Thomas to do the same. He did, grabbed the  sandwich, but hesitated, the writhing, monstrous image of what hed seen in the shack  popping back into his mind. Soon, though, his hunger won out and he took a huge bite.  The wonderful tastes of ham and cheese and mayonnaise filled his mouth. Ah, man, Thomas mumbled through a mouthful. I was starving. Told ya. Chuck chomped into his own sandwich. After another couple of bites, Thomas finally asked the question that had been bothering  him. Whats actually wrong with that Ben guy? He doesnt even look human anymore. Chuck glanced over at the house. Dont really know, he muttered absently. I didnt see  him. Thomas could tell the boy was being less than honest but decided not to press him. Well,  you dont want to see him, trust me. He continued to eat, munching on the apples as he  studied the huge breaks in the walls. Though it was hard to make out from where he sat,  there was something odd about the stone edges of the exits to the outside corridors. He felt  an uncomfortable sense of vertigo looking at the towering walls, as if he hovered above  them instead of sitting at their base. Whats out there? he asked, finally breaking the silence. Is this part of a huge castle or  something?   Chuck hesitated. Looked uncomfortable. Urn, Ive never been outside the Glade. Thomas paused. Youre hiding something, he finally replied, finishing off his last bite  and taking a long swig of water. The frustration at getting no answers from anyone was  starting to grind his nerves. It only made it worse to think that even if he did get answers,  he wouldnt know if hed be getting the truth. Why are you guys so secretive? Thats just the way it is. Things are really weird around here, and most of us dont know  everything. Half of everything. It bothered Thomas that Chuck didnt seem to care about what hed just said. That he  seemed indifferent to having his life taken away from him. What was wrong with these  people? Thomas got to his feet and started walking toward the eastern opening. Well, no  one said I couldnt look around. He needed to learn something or he was going to lose his  mind. Whoa, wait Chuck cried, running to catch up. Be careful, those puppies are about to  close. He already sounded out of breath.  Close? Thomas repeated. What are you talking about?  The Doors, you shank. Doors? I dont see any doors. Thomas knew Chuck wasnt just making stuff up — he  knew he was missing something obvious. He grew uneasy and realized hed slowed his  pace, not so eager to reach the walls anymore. What do you call those big openings? Chuck pointed up at the enormously tall gaps in  the walls. They were only thirty feet away now. Id call them big openings, Thomas said, trying to counter his discomfort with sarcasm  and disappointed that it wasnt working. Well, theyre doors. And they close up every night. Thomas stopped, thinking Chuck had to have said something wrong. He looked up,  looked side to side, examined the massive slabs of stone as the uneasy feeling blossomed  into outright dread. What do you mean, they close? Just see for yourself in a minute. The Runnersll be back soon; then those big walls are  going to move until the gaps are closed. Youre jacked in the head, Thomas muttered. He couldnt see how the mammoth walls  could possibly be mobile — felt so sure of it he relaxed, thinking Chuck was just playing a  trick on him. They reached the huge split that led outside to more stone pathways. Thomas gaped, his  mind emptying of thought as he saw it all firsthand. This is called the East Door, Chuck said, as if proudly revealing a piece of art hed  created. Thomas barely heard him, shocked by how much bigger it was up close. At least twenty  feet across, the break in the wall went all the way to the top, far above. The edges that  bordered the vast opening were smooth, except for one odd, repeating pattern on both  sides. On the left side of the East Door, deep holes several inches in diameter and spaced a  foot apart were bored into the rock, beginning near the ground and continuing all the way  up. On the right side of the Door, foot-long rods jutted out from the wall edge, also several  inches in diameter, in the same pattern as the holes facing them on the other side. The   purpose was obvious. Are you kidding? Thomas asked, the dread slamming back into his gut. You werent  playing with me? The walls really move?  What else would I have meant? Thomas had a hard time wrapping his mind around the possibility. I dont know. I  figured there was a door that swung shut or a little mini-wall that slid out of the big one.  How could these walls move? Theyre huge, and they look like theyve been standing here  for a thousand years. And the idea of those walls closing and trapping him inside this  place they called the Glade was downright terrifying. Chuck threw his arms up, clearly frustrated. I dont know, they just move. Makes one  heck of a grinding noise. Same thing happens out in the Maze — those walls shift every  night, too. Thomas, his attention suddenly snapped up by a new detail, turned to face the younger  boy. What did you just say?  Huh? You just called it a maze — you said, same thing happens out in the maze.  Chucks face reddened. Im done with you. Im done. He walked back toward the tree  theyd just left. Thomas ignored him, more interested than ever in the outside of the Glade. Amaze? In  front of him, through the East Door, he could make out passages leading to the left, to the  right, and straight ahead. And the walls of the corridors were similar to those that  surrounded the Glade, the ground made of the same massive stone blocks as in the  courtyard. The ivy seemed even thicker out there. In the distance, more breaks in the walls  led to other paths, and farther down, maybe a hundred yards or so away, the straight  passage came to a dead end. Looks like a maze, Thomas whispered, almost laughing to himself. As if things couldnt  have gotten any stranger. Theyd wiped his memory and put him inside a gigantic maze. It  was all so crazy it really did seem funny. His heart skipped a beat when a boy unexpectedly appeared around a corner up ahead,  entering the main passage from one of the offshoots to the right, running toward him and  the Glade. Covered in sweat, his face red, clothes sticking to his body, the boy didnt slow,  hardly glancing at Thomas as he went past. He headed straight for the squat concrete  building located near the Box. Thomas turned as he passed, his eyes riveted to the exhausted runner, unsure why this  new development surprised him so much. Why wouldnt people go out and search the maze?  Then he realized others were entering through the remaining three Glade openings, all of  them running and looking as ragged as the guy whod just whisked by him. There couldnt  be much good about the maze if these guys came back looking so weary and worn. He watched, curious, as they met at the big iron door of the small building; one of the  boys turned the rusty wheel handle, grunting with the effort. Chuck had said something  about runners earlier. What had they been doing out there? The big door finally popped open, and with a deafening squeal of metal against metal,  the boys swung it wide. They disappeared inside, pulling it shut behind them with a loud  clonk. Thomas stared, his mind churning to come up with any possible explanation for   what hed just witnessed. Nothing developed, but something about that creepy old building  gave him goose bumps, a disquieting chill. Someone tugged on his sleeve, breaking him from his thoughts; Chuck had come back. Before Thomas had a chance to think, questions were rushing out of his mouth. Who are  those guys and what were they doing? Whats in that building? He wheeled around and  pointed out the East Door. And why do you live inside a freaking maze? He felt a rattling  pressure of uncertainty, making his head splinter with pain. Im not saying another word, Chuck replied, a new authority filling his voice. I think  you should get to bed early — youll need your sleep. Ah — he stopped, held up a finger,  pricking up his right ear — its about to happen. What? Thomas asked, thinking it kind of strange that Chuck was suddenly acting like  an adult instead of the little kid desperate for a friend hed been only moments earlier. A loud boom exploded through the air, making Thomas jump. It was followed by a  horrible crunching, grinding sound. He stumbled backward, fell to the ground. It felt as if  the whole earth shook; he looked around, panicked. The walls were closing. The walls were  really closing — trapping him inside the Glade. An onrushing sense of claustrophobia stifled  him, compressed his lungs, as if water filled their cavities.'

const midaj = 'Calm down, Greenie, Chuck yelled over the noise. Its just the walls Thomas barely heard him, too fascinated, too shaken by the closing of the Doors. He  scrambled to his feet and took a few trembling steps back for a better view, finding it hard  to believe what his eyes were seeing. The enormous stone wall to the right of them seemed to defy every known law of physics  as it slid along the ground, throwing sparks and dust as it moved, rock against rock. The  crunching sound rattled his bones. Thomas realized that only that wall was moving,  heading for its neighbor to the left, ready to seal shut with its protruding rods slipping into  the drilled holes across from it. He looked around at the other openings. It felt like his head  was spinning faster than his body, and his stomach flipped over with the dizziness. On all  four sides of the Glade, only the right walls were moving, toward the left, closing the gap  of the Doors. Impossible, he thought. How can they do that? He fought the urge to run out there, slip  past the moving slabs of rock before they shut, flee the Glade. Common sense won out — the  maze held even more unknowns than his situation inside. He tried to picture in his mind how the structure of it all worked. Massive stone walls,  hundreds of feet high, moving like sliding glass doors — an image from his past life that  flashed through his thoughts. He tried to grasp the memory, hold on to it, complete the  picture with faces, names, a place, but it faded into obscurity. A pang of sadness pricked  through his other swirling emotions. He watched as the right wall reached the end of its journey, its connecting rods finding  their mark and entering without a glitch. An echoing boom rumbled across the Glade as all  four Doors sealed shut for the night. Thomas felt one final moment of trepidation, a quick  slice of fear through his body, and then it vanished. A surprising sense of calm eased his nerves; he let out a long sigh of relief. Wow, he  said, feeling dumb at such a monumental understatement. Aint nothin, as Alby would say, Chuck murmured. You kind of get used to it after a   while. Thomas looked around one more time, the feel of the place completely different now that  all the walls were solid with no way out. He tried to imagine the purpose of such a thing,  and he didnt know which guess was worse — that they were being sealed in or that they  were being protected from something out there. The thought ended his brief moment of  calm, stirring in his mind a million possibilities of what might live in the maze outside, all  of them terrifying. Fear gripped him once again. Come on, Chuck said, pulling at Thomass sleeve a second time. Trust me, when  nighttime strikes, you want to be in bed.  Thomas knew he had no other choice. He did his best to suppress everything he was  feeling and followed.   CHAPTER 5   They ended up near the back of the Homestead — that was what Chuck called the leaning  structure of wood and windows — in a dark shadow between the building and the stone wall  behind it. Where are we going? Thomas asked, still feeling the weight of seeing those walls close,  thinking about the maze, the confusion, the fear. He told himself to stop or hed drive  himself crazy. Trying to grasp a sense of normalcy, he made a weak attempt at a joke. If  youre looking for a goodnight kiss, forget it. Chuck didnt miss a beat. Just shut up and stay close. Thomas let out a big breath and shrugged before following the younger boy along the  back of the building. They tiptoed until they came upon a small, dusty window, a soft beam  of light shining through onto the stone and ivy. Thomas heard someone moving around  inside. The bathroom, Chuck whispered. So? A thread of unease stitched along Thomass skin. I love doing this to people. Gives me great pleasure before bedtime. Doing what? Something told Thomas Chuck was up to no good. Maybe I should —  Just shut your mouth and watch. Chuck quietly stepped up onto a big wooden box that  sat right under the window. He crouched so that his head was positioned just below where  the person on the inside would be able to see him. Then he reached up with his hand and  lightly tapped on the glass. This is stupid, Thomas whispered. There couldnt possibly be a worse time to play a  joke — Newt or Alby could be in there. I dont wanna get in trouble — I just got here Chuck suppressed a laugh by putting his hand over his mouth. Ignoring Thomas, he  reached up and tapped the window again. A shadow crossed the light; then the window slid open. Thomas jumped to hide, pressing  himself against the back of the building as hard as he could. He just couldnt believe hed  been suckered into playing a practical joke on somebody. The angle of vision from the  window protected him for the moment, but he knew he and Chuck would be seen if  whoever was in there pushed his head outside to get a better look. Whos that yelled the boy from the bathroom, his voice scratchy and laced with anger.  Thomas had to hold in a gasp when he realized it was Gaily — he knew that voice already. Without warning, Chuck suddenly popped his head up toward the window and screamed  at the top of his lungs. A loud crash from inside revealed that the trick had worked — and  the litany of swearwords following it let them know Gaily was none too happy about it.  Thomas was struck with an odd mix of horror and embarrassment. Im gonna kill you, shuck-face Gaily yelled, but Chuck was already off the box and  running toward the open Glade. Thomas froze as he heard Gaily open the door inside and  run out of the bathroom. Thomas finally snapped out of his daze and took off after his new — and only — friend.   Hed just rounded the corner when Gaily came screaming out of the Homestead, looking  like a ferocious beast on the loose.  He immediately pointed at Thomas. Come here he yelled. Thomass heart sank in surrender. Everything seemed to indicate that hed be getting a  fist in the face. It wasnt me, I swear, he said, though as he stood there, he sized the boy  up and realized he shouldnt be so terrified after all. Gaily wasnt that big — Thomas could  actually take him if he had to. Wasnt you? Gaily snarled. He ambled up to Thomas slowly and stopped right in front  of him. Then how do you know there was something you didnt do? Thomas didnt say anything. He was definitely uncomfortable but not nearly as scared as  a few moments earlier. Im not a dong, Greenie, Gaily spat. I saw Chucks fat face in the window. He pointed  again, this time right at Thomass chest. But you better decide right quick who you want as  your friends and enemies, hear me? One more trick like that — I dont care if its your sissy  idea or not — therell be blood spilled. You got that, Newbie? But before Thomas could  answer Gallyd already turned to walk away. Thomas just wanted this episode over. Sorry, he muttered, wincing at how stupid it  sounded. I know you, Gaily added without looking back. I saw you in the Changing, and Im  gonna figure out who you are. Thomas watched as the bully disappeared back into the Homestead. He couldnt  remember much, but something told him hed never disliked someone so strongly. He was  surprised by how much he truly hated the guy. He really, really hated him. He turned to see  Chuck standing there, staring at the ground, clearly embarassed. Thanks a lot, buddy.  Sorry — if Id known it was Gaily, I never wouldve done it, I swear. Surprising himself, Thomas laughed. An hour ago, hed thought hed never hear such a  sound come out of his mouth again. Chuck looked closely at Thomas and slowly broke into an uneasy grin. What? Thomas shook his head. Dont be sorry. The ... shank deserved it, and I dont even know  what a shank is. That was awesome. He felt much better. A couple of hours later, Thomas was lying in a soft sleeping bag next to Chuck on a bed of  grass near the gardens. It was a wide lawn that he hadnt noticed before, and quite a few of  the group chose it as their bedtime spot. Thomas thought that was strange, but apparently  there wasnt enough room inside the Homestead. At least it was warm. Which made him  wonder for the millionth time where they were. His mind had a hard time grasping names  of places, or remembering countries or rulers, how the world was organized. And none of  the kids in the Glade had a clue, either — at least, they werent sharing if they did. He lay in silence for the longest time, looking at the stars and listening to the soft  murmurs of various conversations drifting across the Glade. Sleep felt miles away, and he  couldnt shake the despair and hopelessness that coursed through his body and mind — the  temporary joy of Chucks trick on Gaily had long since faded away. Itd been one endless —  and strange — day. It was just so ... weird. He remembered lots of little things about life — eating, clothes'
const midai = 'studying, playing, general images of the makeup of the world. But any detail that would fill  in the picture to create a true and complete memory had been erased somehow. It was like  looking at an image through a foot of muddy water. More than anything else, perhaps, he  felt ... sad. Chuck interrupted his thoughts. Well, Greenie, you survived First Day.  Barely. Not now, Chuck, he wanted to say. Im not in the mood. Chuck pulled himself up to lean on an elbow, looking at Thomas. Youll learn a lot in  the next couple of days, start getting used to things. Good that? Urn, yeah, good that, I guess. Whered all these weird words and phrases come from,  anyway? It seemed like theyd taken some other language and melded it with his own. Chuck flopped back down with a heavy flump. I dont know — Ive only been here a  month, remember? Thomas wondered about Chuck, whether he knew more than he let on. He was a quirky  kid, funny, and he seemed innocent, but who was to say? Really he was just as mysterious  as everything else in the Glade. A few minutes passed, and Thomas felt the long day finally catch up to him, the leaded  edge of sleep crossing over his mind. But — like a fist had shoved it in his brain and let go —  a thought popped into his head. One that he didnt expect, and he wasnt sure from where  it came. Suddenly, the Glade, the walls, the Maze — it all seemed ... familiar. Comfortable. A  warmth of calmness spread through his chest, and for the first time since hed found himself  there, he didnt feel like the Glade was the worst place in the universe. He stilled, felt his  eyes widen, his breathing stop for a long moment. What just happened? he thought. What  changed? Ironically, the feeling that things would be okay made him slightly uneasy. Not quite understanding how, he knew what he needed to do. He didnt get it. The  feeling — the epiphany — was a strange one, foreign and familiar at the same time. But it felt  ... right. I want to be one of those guys that goes out there, he said aloud, not knowing if Chuck  was still awake. Inside the Maze. Huh? was the response from Chuck. Thomas could hear a tinge of annoyance in his  voice. Runners, Thomas said, wishing he knew where this was coming from. Whatever  theyre doing out there, I want in. You dont even know what youre talking about, Chuck grumbled, and rolled over. Go  to sleep. Thomas felt a new surge of confidence, even though he truly didnt know what he was  talking about. I want to be a Runner. Chuck turned back and got up on his elbow. You can forget that little thought right  now. Thomas wondered at Chucks reaction, but pressed on. Dont try to — Thomas. Newbie. My new friend. Forget it. Ill tell Alby tomorrow. A Runner, Thomas thought. J dont even know what that means.  Have I gone completely insane?  Chuck lay down with a laugh. Youre a piece of klunk. Go to sleep.   But Thomas couldnt quit. Something out there — it feels familiar.  Go ... to ... sleep. Then it hit Thomas — he felt like several pieces of a puzzle had been put together. He  didnt know what the ultimate picture would be, but his next words almost felt like they  were coming from someone else. Chuck, I ... I think Ive been here before. He heard his friend sit up, heard the intake of breath. But Thomas rolled over and refused  to say another word, worried hed mess up this new sense of being encouraged, eradicate  the reassuring calm that filled his heart. Sleep came much more easily than hed expected.   CHAPTER 6   Someone shook Thomas awake. His eyes snapped open to see a too-close face staring down  at him, everything around them still shadowed by the darkness of early morning. He  opened his mouth to speak but a cold hand clamped down on it, gripping it shut. Panic  flared until he saw who it was.  Shh, Greenie. Dont wanna be wakin Chuckie, now, do we? It was Newt — the guy who seemed to be second in command; the air reeked of his  morning breath. Though Thomas was surprised, any alarm melted away immediately. He couldnt help  being curious, wondering what this boy wanted with him. Thomas nodded, doing his best to  say yes with his eyes, until Newt finally took his hand away, then leaned back on his heels. Come on, Greenie, the tall boy whispered as he stood. He reached down and helped  Thomas to his feet — he was so strong it felt like he could rip Thomass arm off. Supposed  to show ya somethin before the wake-up. Any lingering haze of sleep had already vanished from Thomass mind. Okay, he said  simply, ready to follow. He knew he should hold some suspicion, having no reason to trust  anyone yet, but the curiosity won out. He quickly leaned over and slipped on his shoes.  Where are we going? Just follow me. And stay close. They snuck their way through the tightly strewn pack of sleeping bodies, Thomas almost  tripping several times. He stepped on someones hand, earning a sharp cry of pain in  return, then a punch on the calf. Sorry, he whispered, ignoring a dirty look from Newt. Once they left the lawn area and stepped onto the hard gray stone of the courtyard floor,  Newt broke into a run, heading for the western wall. Thomas hesitated at first, wondering  why he needed to run, but snapped out of it quickly and followed at the same pace. The light was dim, but any obstructions loomed as darker shadows and he was able to  make his way quickly along. He stopped when Newt did, right next to the massive wall  towering above them like a skyscraper — another random image that floated in the murky  pool of his memory wipe. Thomas noticed small red lights flashing here and there along the  walls face, moving about, stopping, turning off and on. What are those? he whispered as loudly as he dared, wondering if his voice sounded as  shaky as he felt. The twinkling red glow of the lights held an undercurrent of warning. Newt stood just a couple of feet in front of the thick curtain of ivy on the wall. When  you bloody need to know, youll know, Greenie. Well, its kind of stupid to send me to a place where nothing makes sense and not  answer my questions. Thomas paused, surprised at himself. Shank, he added, throwing  all the sarcasm he could into the syllable.'

const midah = 'Newt broke out in a laugh, but quickly cut it off. I like you, Greenie. Now shut it and let  me show ya somethin.   Newt stepped forward and dug his hands into the thick ivy, spreading several vines away  from the wall to reveal a dust-frosted window, a square about two feet wide. It was dark at  the moment, as if it had been painted black. Whatre we looking for? Thomas whispered. Hold your undies, boy. Onell be comin along soon enough. A minute passed, then two. Several more. Thomas fidgeted on his feet, wondering how  Newt could stand there, perfectly patient and still, staring into nothing but darkness.  Then it changed. Glimmers of an eerie light shone through the window; it cast a wavering spectrum of  colors on Newts body and face, as if he stood next to a lighted swimming pool. Thomas  grew perfectly still, squinting, trying to make out what was on the other side. A thick lump  grew in his throat. What is that? he thought. Out theres the Maze, Newt whispered, eyes wide as if in a trance. Everything we do —  our whole life, Greenie — revolves around the Maze. Every lovin second of every lovin day  we spend in honor of the Maze, tryin to solve somethin thats not shown us it has a bloody  solution, ya know? And we want to show ya why its not to be messed with. Show ya why  them buggin walls close shut every night. Show ya why you should never, never find your  butt out there. Newt stepped back, still holding on to the ivy vines. He gestured for Thomas to take his  place and look through the window. Thomas did, leaning forward until his nose touched the cool surface of the glass. It took a  second for his eyes to focus on the moving object on the other side, to look past the grime  and dust and see what Newt wanted him to see. And when he did, he felt his breath catch  in his throat, like an icy wind had blown down there and frozen the air solid. A large, bulbous creature the size of a cow but with no distinct shape twisted and seethed  along the ground in the corridor outside. It climbed the opposite wall, then leaped at the  thick-glassed window with a loud thump. Thomas shrieked before he could stop himself,  jerked away from the window — but the thing bounced backward, leaving the glass  undamaged. Thomas sucked in two huge breaths and leaned in once again. It was too dark to make  out clearly, but odd lights flashed from an unknown source, revealing blurs of silver spikes  and glistening flesh. Wicked instrument-tipped appendages protruded from its body like  arms: a saw blade, a set of shears, long rods whose purpose could only be guessed. The creature was a horrific mix of animal and machine, and seemed to realize it was  being observed, seemed to know what lay inside the walls of the Glade, seemed to want to  get inside and feast on human flesh. Thomas felt an icy terror blossom in his chest, expand  like a tumor, making it hard to breathe. Even with the memory wipe, he felt sure hed  never seen something so truly awful. He stepped back, the courage hed felt the previous evening melting away. What is that thing? he asked. Something shivered in his gut, and he wondered if hed  ever be able to eat again. Grievers, we call em, Newt answered. Nasty bugger, eh? Just be glad the Grievers  only come out at night. Be thankful for these walls. Thomas swallowed, wondering how he could ever go out there. His desire to become a   Runner had taken a major blow. But he had to do it. Somehow he knew he had to do it. It  was such an odd thing to feel, especially after what hed just seen. Newt looked at the window absently. Now you know what bloody lurks in the Maze, my  friend. Now you know this isnt joke time. Youve been sent to the Glade, Greenie, and well  be expectin ya to survive and help us do what weve been sent here to do. And whats that? Thomas asked, even though he was terrified to hear the answer. Newt turned to look him dead in the eye. The first traces of dawn had crept up on them,  and Thomas could see every detail of Newts face, his skin tight, his brow creased. Find our way out, Greenie, Newt said. Solve the buggin Maze and find our way  home. A couple of hours later, the doors having reopened, rumbling and grumbling and shaking  the ground until they were finished, Thomas sat at a worn, tilted picnic table outside the  Homestead. All he could think about was the Grievers, what their purpose could be, what  they did out there during the night. What it would be like to be attacked by something so  terrible. He tried to get the image out of his head, move on to something else. The Runners.  Theyd just left without saying a word to anybody, bolting into the Maze at full speed and  disappearing around corners. He pictured them in his mind as he picked at his eggs and  bacon with a fork, speaking to no one, not even Chuck, who ate silently next to him. The  poor guy had exhausted himself trying to start a conversation with Thomas, whod refused  to respond. All he wanted was to be left alone. He just didnt get it; his brain was on overload trying to compute the sheer impossibility  of the situation. How could a maze, with walls so massive and tall, be so big that dozens of  kids hadnt been able to solve it after who knew how long trying? How could such a  structure exist? And more importantly, why? What could possibly be the purpose of such a  thing? Why were they all there? How long had they been there? Try as he might to avoid it, his mind still kept wandering back to the image of the vicious  Griever. Its phantom brother seemed to leap at him every time he blinked or rubbed his  eyes. Thomas knew he was a smart kid — he somehow felt it in his bones. But nothing about  this place made any sense. Except for one thing. He was supposed to be a Runner. Why did  he feel that so strongly? And even now, after seeing what lived in the maze? A tap on his shoulder jarred him from his thoughts; he looked up to see Alby standing  behind him, arms folded. Aint you lookin fresh? Alby said. Get a nice view out the window this morning? Thomas stood, hoping the time for answers had come — or maybe hoping for a distraction  from his gloomy thoughts. Enough to make me want to learn about this place, he said,  hoping to avoid provoking the temper hed seen flare in this guy the day before. Alby nodded. Me and you, shank. The Tour begins now. He started to move but then  stopped, holding up a finger. Aint no questions till the end, you get me? Aint got time to  jaw with you all day. But ... Thomas stopped when Albys eyebrows shot up. Why did the guy have to be  such a jerk? But tell me everything — I wanna know everything. Hed decided the night   before not to tell anyone else how strangely familiar the place seemed, the odd feeling that  hed been there before — that he could remember things about it. Sharing that seemed like a  very bad idea. Ill tell ya what I wanna tell ya, Greenie. Lets go. Can I come? Chuck asked from the table. Alby reached down and tweaked the boys ear. Ow Chuck shrieked.'

const high1 = 'In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.  Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so silvery warm--a pins-head of light It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.  As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than forty millions of miles of void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.  Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.  That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.  That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.  He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress.  He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.  The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one, he said.  Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each night.  Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain.  It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planets atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features.  Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon.  And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did.  I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.  One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.  It was a warm night.  Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music.  There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.  My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky.  It seemed so safe and tranquil.  CHAPTER TWO  THE FALLING STAR Then came the night of the first falling star.  It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the atmosphere.  Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star.  Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds.  Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles.  It seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.  I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed.  Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound.  I myself heard nothing of that.  Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.  But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it.  Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand pits.  An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.  The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn.  The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent.  The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation.  It had a diameter of about thirty yards.  He approached the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely.  It was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.  A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow.  He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival.  The early morning was wonderfully still, and the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm.  He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder.  He was all alone on the common.  Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge of the end.  It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand.  A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.  For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly.  He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.  And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body.  It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference.  Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so.  Then the thing came upon him in a flash.  The cylinder was artificial--hollow--with an end that screwed out Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top  Good heavens said Ogilvy.  Theres a man in it--men in it Half roasted to death  Trying to escape  At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash upon Mars.  The thought of the'

const high2 = 'confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn.  But luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still-glowing metal.  At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking.  The time then must have been somewhere about six oclock. He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild--his hat had fallen off in the pit--that the man simply drove on.  He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.  The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.  That sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood.  Henderson, he called, you saw that shooting star last night?  Well? said Henderson.  Its out on Horsell Common now.  Good Lord said Henderson.  Fallen meteorite  Thats good.  But its something more than a meteorite.  Its a cylinder--an artificial cylinder, man  And theres something inside.  Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.  Whats that? he said.  He was deaf in one ear.  Ogilvy told him all that he had seen.  Henderson was a minute or so taking it in.  Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road.  The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position.  But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder.  Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.  They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead.  Of course the two were quite unable to do anything.  They shouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get help.  One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows.  Henderson went into the railway station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London.  The newspaper articles had prepared mens minds for the reception of the idea.  By eight oclock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from Mars.  That was the form the story took.  I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_.  I was naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge to the sand pits.  CHAPTER THREE  ON HORSELL COMMON I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground.  The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion.  No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Hendersons house.  There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until I stopped them--by throwing stones at the giant mass.  After I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders.  Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station.  There was very little talking.  Few of the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days.  Most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was there, and other people came.  I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet.  The top had certainly ceased to rotate.  It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It looked like a rusty gas float.  It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue.  Extra-terrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers.  At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature.  I thought the unscrewing might be automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars.  My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an impatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations.  In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.  The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with enormous headlines:  A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.  REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,  and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvys wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.  There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicycles.  In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others.  It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees.  The burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer.  Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes.  Stent was giving directions in a clear, high-pitched voice.  He was standing on the cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.  A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.  The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations, especially the boys.  They wanted a light railing put up, and help to keep the people back.  He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.  I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.  I failed to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the six oclock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to waylay him.This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door. The music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull broom, broom of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied with each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics. Seeing the throng, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the ancestors of her coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage, plunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall. Once within, she turned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime, Eik Eik Uzdaryk-duris in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like fairy music.  Z. Graiczunas, Pasilinksminimams darzas. Vynas. Sznapsas. Wines and Liquors. Union Headquarters--that was the way the signs ran. The reader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of far-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was the rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as back of the yards. This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact; but how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood that it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of Gods'

 const high3 = 'gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the joy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite  She stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from pushing through the crowd, and in her happiness painful to look upon. There was a light of wonder in her eyes and her lids trembled, and her otherwise wan little face was flushed. She wore a muslin dress, conspicuously white, and a stiff little veil coming to her shoulders. There were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright green rose leaves. There were new white cotton gloves upon her hands, and as she stood staring about her she twisted them together feverishly. It was almost too much for her--you could see the pain of too great emotion in her face, and all the tremor of her form. She was so young--not quite sixteen--and small for her age, a mere child; and she had just been married--and married to Jurgis,* (*Pronounced Yoorghis) of all men, to Jurgis Rudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black suit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands.  Ona was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his ears--in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible married couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all prophets, before and after. Jurgis could take up a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car without a stagger, or even a thought; and now he stood in a far corner, frightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his lips with his tongue each time before he could answer the congratulations of his friends.  Gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and the guests--a separation at least sufficiently complete for working purposes. There was no time during the festivities which ensued when there were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners; and if any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked sufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him, and he was invited to the feast. It was one of the laws of the veselija that no one goes hungry; and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to apply in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a million inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who ran in from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier. A charming informality was one of the characteristics of this celebration. The men wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took them off, and their coats with them; they ate when and where they pleased, and moved as often as they pleased. There were to be speeches and singing, but no one had to listen who did not care to; if he wished, meantime, to speak or sing himself, he was perfectly free. The resulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the babies, of which there were present a number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited. There was no other place for the babies to be, and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted of a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner. In these the babies slept, three or four together, or wakened together, as the case might be. Those who were still older, and could reach the tables, marched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages. The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save for a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a gilded frame. To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few loafers in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a presiding genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a carefully oiled curl plastered against one side of his forehead. In the opposite corner are two tables, filling a third of the room and laden with dishes and cold viands, which a few of the hungrier guests are already munching. At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white cake, with an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses and two angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and yellow candies. Beyond opens a door into the kitchen, where there is a glimpse to be had of a range with much steam ascending from it, and many women, old and young, rushing hither and thither. In the corner to the left are the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling heroically to make some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies, similarly occupied, and an open window whence the populace imbibes the sights and sounds and odors.  Suddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it, you discern Aunt Elizabeth, Onas stepmother--Teta Elzbieta, as they call her--bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck. Behind her is Kotrina, making her way cautiously, staggering beneath a similar burden; and half a minute later there appears old Grandmother Majauszkiene, with a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big as herself. So, bit by bit, the feast takes form--there is a ham and a dish of sauerkraut, boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great piles of penny buns, bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer. There is also, not six feet from your back, the bar, where you may order all you please and do not have to pay for it. Eiksz Graicziau screams Marija Berczynskas, and falls to work herself--for there is more upon the stove inside that will be spoiled if it be not eaten.  So, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the guests take their places. The young men, who for the most part have been huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and the shrinking Jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he consents to seat himself at the right hand of the bride. The two bridesmaids, whose insignia of office are paper wreaths, come next, and after them the rest of the guests, old and young, boys and girls. The spirit of the occasion takes hold of the stately bartender, who condescends to a plate of stewed duck; even the fat policeman--whose duty it will be, later in the evening, to break up the fights--draws up a chair to the foot of the table. And the children shout and the babies yell, and every one laughs and sings and chatters--while above all the deafening clamor Cousin Marija shouts orders to the musicians.  The musicians--how shall one begin to describe them? All this time they have been there, playing in a mad frenzy--all of this scene must be read, or said, or sung, to music. It is the music which makes it what it is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of a saloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky.  The little person who leads this trio is an inspired man. His fiddle is out of tune, and there is no rosin on his bow, but still he is an inspired man--the hands of the muses have been laid upon him. He plays like one possessed by a demon, by a whole horde of demons. You can feel them in the air round about him, capering frenetically; with their invisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the orchestra rises on end, and his eyeballs start from their sockets, as he toils to keep up with them.  Tamoszius Kuszleika is his name, and he has taught himself to play the violin by practicing all night, after working all day on the killing beds. He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy. A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band. He is only about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight inches short of the ground. You wonder where he can have gotten them or rather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his presence left you time to think of such things.  For he is an inspired man. Every inch of him is inspired--you might almost say inspired separately. He stamps with his feet, he tosses his head, he sways and swings to and fro; he has a wizened-up little face, irresistibly comical; and, when he executes a turn or a flourish, his brows knit and his lips work and his eyelids wink--the very ends of his necktie bristle out. And every now and then he turns upon his companions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically--with every inch of him appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call.  For they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of the orchestra. The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with black-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven mule; he responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back into his old rut. The third man is very fat, with a round, red, sentimental nose, and he plays with his eyes turned up to the sky and a look of infinite yearning. He is playing a bass part upon his cello, and so the excitement is nothing to him; no matter what happens in the treble, it is his task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note after another, from four oclock in the afternoon until nearly the same hour next morning, for his third of the total income of one dollar per hour.  Before the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika has risen in his excitement; a minute or two more and you see that he is beginning to edge over toward the tables. His nostrils are dilated and his breath comes fast--his demons are driving him. He nods and shakes his head at his companions, jerking at them with his violin, until at last the long form of the second violinist also rises up. In the end all three of them begin advancing, step by step, upon the banqueters, Valentinavyczia, the cellist, bumping along with his instrument between notes. Finally all three are gathered at the foot of the tables, and there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool.  Now he is in his glory, dominating the scene. Some of the people are eating, some are laughing and talking--but you will make a great mistake if you think there is one of them who does not hear him. His notes are never true, and his fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and scratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they heed the dirt and noise and squalor about them--it is out of this material that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to utter their souls. And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous, or mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is their music, music of home. It stretches out its arms to them, they have only to give themselves up. Chicago and its saloons and its slums fade away--there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and snow-clad hills. They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes returning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and griefs to laugh and weep. Some fall back and close their eyes, some beat upon the table. Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for this song or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius eyes, and he flings up his fiddle and shouts to his companions, and away they go in mad career. The company takes up the choruses, and men and women cry out like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the floor, lifting their glasses and pledging each other. Before long it occurs to some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the beauty of the bride and the joys of love. In the excitement of this masterpiece Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables, making his way toward the head, where sits the bride. There is not a foot of space between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so short that he pokes them with his bow whenever he reaches over for the low notes; but still he presses in, and insists relentlessly that his companions must follow. During their progress, needless to say, the sounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three are at the head, and Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of the bride and begins to pour out his soul in melting strains.  Little Ona is too excited to eat. Once in a while she tastes a little something, when Cousin Marija pinches her elbow and reminds her; but, for the most part, she sits gazing with the same fearful eyes of wonder. Teta Elzbieta is all in a flutter, like a hummingbird; her sisters, too, keep running up behind her, whispering, breathless. But Ona seems scarcely to hear them--the music keeps calling, and the far-off look comes back, and she sits with her hands pressed together over her heart. Then the tears begin to come into her eyes; and as she is ashamed to wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her cheeks, she turns and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red when she sees that Jurgis is watching her. When in the end Tamoszius Kuszleika has reached her side, and is waving his magic wand above her, Onas cheeks are scarlet, and she looks as if she would have to get up and run away.  In this crisis, however, she is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom the muses suddenly visit. Marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers parting; she wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it, she has risen, and is proceeding to teach them. Marija is short, but powerful in build. She works in a canning factory, and all day long she handles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds. She has a broad Slavic face, with prominent red cheeks. When she opens her mouth, it is tragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse. She wears a blue flannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing her brawny arms; she has a carving fork in her hand, with which she pounds on the table to mark the time. As she roars her song, in a voice of which it is enough to say that it leaves no portion of the room vacant, the three musicians follow her, laboriously and note by note, but averaging one note behind; thus they toil through stanza after stanza of a lovesick swains lamentation:--  Sudiev kvietkeli, tu brangiausis; Sudiev ir laime, man biednam, Matau--paskyre teip Aukszcziausis, Jog vargt ant svieto reik vienam  When the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas rises to his feet. Grandfather Anthony, Jurgis father, is not more than sixty years of age, but you would think that he was eighty. He has been only six months in America, and the change has not done him good. In his manhood he worked in a cotton mill, but then a coughing fell upon him, and he had to leave; out in the country the trouble disappeared, but he has been working in the pickle rooms at Durhams, and the breathing of the cold, damp air all day has brought it back. Now as he rises he is seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by his chair and turns away his wan and battered face until it passes.  Generally it is the custom for the speech at a veselija to be taken out of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his youthful days Dede Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love letters of his friends. Now it is understood that he has composed an original speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of the events of the day. Even the boys, who are romping about the room, draw near and listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons in their eyes. It is very solemn, for Antanas Rudkus has become possessed of the idea that he has not much longer to stay with his children. His speech leaves them all so tearful that one of the guests, Jokubas Szedvilas, who keeps a delicatessen store on Halsted Street, and is fat and hearty, is moved to rise and say that things may not be as bad as that, and then to go on and make a little speech of his own, in which he showers congratulations and prophecies of happiness upon the bride and groom, proceeding to particulars which greatly delight the young men, but which cause Ona to blush more furiously than ever. Jokubas possesses what his wife complacently describes as poetiszka vaidintuve--a poetical imagination.  Now a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no pretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up. Some of the men gather about the bar; some wander about, laughing and singing; here and there will be a little group, chanting merrily, and in sublime indifference to the others and to the orchestra as well. Everybody is more or less restless--one would guess that something is on their minds. And so it proves. The last tardy diners are scarcely given time to finish, before the tables and the debris are shoved into the corner, and the chairs and the babies piled out of the way, and the real celebration of the evening begins. Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after replenishing himself with a pot of beer, returns to his platform, and, standing up, reviews the scene; he taps authoritatively upon the side of his violin, then tucks it carefully under his chin, then waves his bow in an elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings and closes his eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a dreamy waltz. His companion follows, but with his eyes open, watching where he treads, so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after waiting for a little and beating with his foot to get the time, casts up his eyes to the ceiling and begins to saw--Broom broom broom  The company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion. Apparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any consequence--there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just as before they sang. Most of them prefer the two-step, especially the young, with whom it is the fashion. The older people have dances from home, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave solemnity. Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each others hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express itself with their feet. Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife, Lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of toothless and perspiring ecstasy.  Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of home--an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons. All these things are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to speak English and to affect the latest style of clothing. The girls wear ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite pretty. Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the type of clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room. Each of these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing. Some hold each other tightly, some at a cautious distance. Some hold their hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides. Some dance springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity. There are boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every one out of their way. There are nervous couples, whom these frighten, and who cry, Nusfok Kas yra? at them as they pass. Each couple is paired for the evening--you will never see them change about. There is Alena Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with Juozas Raczius, to whom she is engaged. Alena is the beauty of the evening, and she would be really beautiful if she were not so proud. She wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a weeks labor painting cans. She holds her skirt with her hand as she dances, with stately precision, after the manner of the grandes dames. Juozas is driving one of Durhams wagons, and is making big wages. He affects a tough aspect, wearing his hat on one side and keeping a cigarette in his mouth all the evening. Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is also beautiful, but humble. Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she has an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so she does not spend her wages for shirtwaists. Jadvyga is small and delicate, with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a little knot and tied on the top of her head. She wears an old white dress which she has made herself and worn to parties for the past five years; it is high-waisted--almost under her arms, and not very becoming,--but that does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her Mikolas. She is small, while he is big and powerful; she nestles in his arms as if she would hide herself from view, and leans her head upon his shoulder. He in turn has clasped his arms tightly around her, as if he would carry her away; and so she dances, and will dance the entire evening, and would dance forever, in ecstasy of bliss. You would smile, perhaps, to see them--but you would not smile if you knew all the story. This is the fifth year, now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas, and her heart is sick. They would have been married in the beginning, only Mikolas has a father who is drunk all day, and he is the only other man in a large family. Even so they might have managed it (for Mikolas is a skilled man) but for cruel accidents which have almost taken the heart out of them. He is a beef-boner, and that is a dangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to earn a bride. Your hands are slippery, and your knife is slippery, and you are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you strike a bone. Then your hand slips up on the blade, and there is a fearful gash. And that would not be so bad, only for the deadly contagion. The cut may heal, but you never can tell. Twice now; within the last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home with blood poisoning--once for three months and once for nearly seven. The last time, too, he lost his job, and that meant six weeks more of standing at the doors of the packing houses, at six oclock on bitter winter mornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air. There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have never looked into a beef-boners hands.  When Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they must, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently. They never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down if they did. It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up again, in spite of all the protests of the other two. This time it is another sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance. Those who prefer to, go on with the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of motions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance. The climax of it is a furious prestissimo, at which the couples seize hands and begin a mad whirling. This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room joins in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies quite dazzling to look upon. But the sight of sights at this moment is Tamoszius Kuszleika. The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but Tamoszius has no mercy. The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he bends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race. His body shakes and throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying showers of notes--there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his bowing arm. With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the tune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing up against the walls of the room.  After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the revelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the evening, which is the acziavimas. The acziavimas is a ceremony which, once begun, will continue for three or four hours, and it involves one uninterrupted dance. The guests form a great ring, locking hands, and, when the music starts up, begin to move around in a circle. In the center stands the bride, and, one by one, the men step into the enclosure and dance with her. Each'

 const high4 = 'dances for several minutes--as long as he pleases; it is a very merry proceeding, with laughter and singing, and when the guest has finished, he finds himself face to face with Teta Elzbieta, who holds the hat. Into it he drops a sum of money--a dollar, or perhaps five dollars, according to his power, and his estimate of the value of the privilege. The guests are expected to pay for this entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see that there is a neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to start life upon.  Most fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this entertainment. They will certainly be over two hundred dollars and maybe three hundred; and three hundred dollars is more than the years income of many a person in this room. There are able-bodied men here who work from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars with a quarter of an inch of water on the floor--men who for six or seven months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon till the next Sunday morning--and who cannot earn three hundred dollars in a year. There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who can hardly see the top of the work benches--whose parents have lied to get them their places--and who do not make the half of three hundred dollars a year, and perhaps not even the third of it. And then to spend such a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast (For obviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your own wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.)  It is very imprudent, it is tragic--but, ah, it is so beautiful Bit by bit these poor people have given up everything else; but to this they cling with all the power of their souls--they cannot give up the veselija To do that would mean, not merely to be defeated, but to acknowledge defeat--and the difference between these two things is what keeps the world going. The veselija has come down to them from a far-off time; and the meaning of it was that one might dwell within the cave and gaze upon shadows, provided only that once in his lifetime he could break his chains, and feel his wings, and behold the sun; provided that once in his lifetime he might testify to the fact that life, with all its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after all, but merely a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one may toss about and play with as a juggler tosses his golden balls, a thing that one may quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine. Thus having known himself for the master of things, a man could go back to his toil and live upon the memory all his days. Endlessly the dancers swung round and round--when they were dizzy they swung the other way. Hour after hour this had continued--the darkness had fallen and the room was dim from the light of two smoky oil lamps. The musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only one tune, wearily, ploddingly. There were twenty bars or so of it, and when they came to the end they began again. Once every ten minutes or so they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back exhausted; a circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and terrifying scene, that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his sleeping place behind the door.  It was all Marija Berczynskas. Marija was one of those hungry souls who cling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse. All day long she had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was leaving--and she would not let it go. Her soul cried out in the words of Faust, Stay, thou art fair Whether it was by beer, or by shouting, or by music, or by motion, she meant that it should not go. And she would go back to the chase of it--and no sooner be fairly started than her chariot would be thrown off the track, so to speak, by the stupidity of those thrice accursed musicians. Each time, Marija would emit a howl and fly at them, shaking her fists in their faces, stamping upon the floor, purple and incoherent with rage. In vain the frightened Tamoszius would attempt to speak, to plead the limitations of the flesh; in vain would the puffing and breathless ponas Jokubas insist, in vain would Teta Elzbieta implore. Szalin Marija would scream. Palauk isz kelio What are you paid for, children of hell? And so, in sheer terror, the orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would return to her place and take up her task.  She bore all the burden of the festivities now. Ona was kept up by her excitement, but all of the women and most of the men were tired--the soul of Marija was alone unconquered. She drove on the dancers--what had once been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with Marija at the stem, pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping, singing, a very volcano of energy. Now and then some one coming in or out would leave the door open, and the night air was chill; Marija as she passed would stretch out her foot and kick the doorknob, and slam would go the door Once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of which Sebastijonas Szedvilas was the hapless victim. Little Sebastijonas, aged three, had been wandering about oblivious to all things, holding turned up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as pop, pink-colored, ice-cold, and delicious. Passing through the doorway the door smote him full, and the shriek which followed brought the dancing to a halt. Marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred times a day, and would weep over the injury of a fly, seized little Sebastijonas in her arms and bid fair to smother him with kisses. There was a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while Marija was making her peace with her victim, seating him upon the bar, and standing beside him and holding to his lips a foaming schooner of beer.such lovers read a play more or less as if they were actors who had to study all the parts. They do not need, of course, to imagine whereabouts the persons are to stand, or what gestures they ought to use; but they want to realise fully and exactly the inner movements which produced these words and no other, these deeds and no other, at each particular moment. This, carried through a drama, is the right way to read the dramatist Shakespeare; and the prime requisite here is therefore a vivid and intent imagination. But this alone will hardly suffice. It is necessary also, especially to a true conception of the whole, to compare, to analyse, to dissect. And such readers often shrink from this task, which seems to them prosaic or even a desecration. They misunderstand, I believe. They would not shrink if they remembered two things. In the first place, in this process of comparison and analysis, it is not requisite, it is on the contrary ruinous, to set imagination aside and to substitute some supposed cold reason; and it is only want of practice that makes the concurrent use of analysis and of poetic perception difficult or irksome.'

  const high5 = 'And, in the second place, these dissecting processes, though they are also imaginative, are still, and are meant to be, nothing but means to an end. When they have finished their work (it can only be finished for the time) they give place to the end, which is that same imaginative reading or re-creation of the drama from which they set out, but a reading now enriched by the products of analysis, and therefore far more adequate and enjoyable.  This, at any rate, is the faith in the strength of which I venture, with merely personal misgivings, on the path of analytic interpretation. And so, before coming to the first of the four tragedies, I propose to discuss some preliminary matters which concern them all. Though each is individual through and through, they have, in a sense, one and the same substance; for in all of them Shakespeare represents the tragic aspect of life, the tragic fact. They have, again, up to a certain point, a common form or structure. This substance and this structure, which would be found to distinguish them, for example, from Greek tragedies, may, to diminish repetition, be considered once for all; and in considering them we shall also be able to observe characteristic differences among the four plays. And to this may be added the little that it seems necessary to premise on the position of these dramas in Shakespeares literary career.  Much that is said on our main preliminary subjects will naturally hold good, within certain limits, of other dramas of Shakespeare beside _Hamlet_, _Othello_, _King Lear_, and _Macbeth_. But it will often apply to these other works only in part, and to some of them more fully than to others. _Romeo and Juliet_, for instance, is a pure tragedy, but it is an early work, and in some respects an immature one. _Richard III._ and _Richard II._, _Julius Caesar_, _Antony and Cleopatra_, and _Coriolanus_ are tragic histories or historical tragedies, in which Shakespeare acknowledged in practice a certain obligation to follow his authority, even when that authority offered him an undramatic material. Probably he himself would have met some criticisms to which these plays are open by appealing to their historical character, and by denying that such works are to be judged by the standard of pure tragedy. In any case, most of these plays, perhaps all, do show, as a matter of fact, considerable deviations from that standard; and, therefore, what is said of the pure tragedies must be applied to them with qualifications which I shall often take for granted without mention. There remain _Titus Andronicus_ and _Timon of Athens_. The former I shall leave out of account, because, even if Shakespeare wrote the whole of it, he did so before he had either a style of his own or any characteristic tragic conception. _Timon_ stands on a different footing. Parts of it are unquestionably Shakespeares, and they will be referred to in one of the later lectures. But much of the writing is evidently not his, and as it seems probable that the conception and construction of the whole tragedy should also be attributed to some other writer, I shall omit this work too from our preliminary discussions.   LECTURE I  THE SUBSTANCE OF SHAKESPEAREAN TRAGEDY The question we are to consider in this lecture may be stated in a variety of ways. We may put it thus: What is the substance of a Shakespearean tragedy, taken in abstraction both from its form and from the differences in point of substance between one tragedy and another? Or thus: What is the nature of the tragic aspect of life as represented by Shakespeare? What is the general fact shown now in this tragedy and now in that? And we are putting the same question when we ask: What is Shakespeares tragic conception, or conception of tragedy?  These expressions, it should be observed, do not imply that Shakespeare himself ever asked or answered such a question; that he set himself to reflect on the tragic aspects of life, that he framed a tragic conception, and still less that, like Aristotle or Corneille, he had a theory of the kind of poetry called tragedy. These things are all possible; how far any one of them is probable we need not discuss; but none of them is presupposed by the question we are going to consider. This question implies only that, as a matter of fact, Shakespeare in writing tragedy did represent a certain aspect of life in a certain way, and that through examination of his writings we ought to be able, to some extent, to describe this aspect and way in terms addressed to the understanding. Such a description, so far as it is true and adequate, may, after these explanations, be called indifferently an account of the substance of Shakespearean tragedy, or an account of Shakespeares conception of tragedy or view of the tragic fact.  Two further warnings may be required. In the first place, we must remember that the tragic aspect of life is only one aspect. We cannot arrive at Shakespeares whole dramatic way of looking at the world from his tragedies alone, as we can arrive at Miltons way of regarding things, or at Wordsworths or at Shelleys, by examining almost any one of their important works. Speaking very broadly, one may say that these poets at their best always look at things in one light; but _Hamlet_ and _Henry IV._ and _Cymbeline_ reflect things from quite distinct positions, and Shakespeares whole dramatic view is not to be identified with any one of these reflections. And, in the second place, I may repeat that in these lectures, at any rate for the most part, we are to be content with his _dramatic_ view, and are not to ask whether it corresponded exactly with his opinions or creed outside his poetry--the opinions or creed of the being whom we sometimes oddly call Shakespeare the man. It does not seem likely that outside his poetry he was a very simple-minded Catholic or Protestant or Atheist, as some have maintained; but we cannot be sure, as with those other poets we can, that in his works he expressed his deepest and most cherished convictions on ultimate questions, or even that he had any. And in his dramatic conceptions there is enough to occupy us. 1  In approaching our subject it will be best, without attempting to shorten the path by referring to famous theories of the drama, to start directly from the facts, and to collect from them gradually an idea of Shakespearean Tragedy. And first, to begin from the outside, such a tragedy brings before us a considerable number of persons (many more than the persons in a Greek play, unless the members of the Chorus are reckoned among them); but it is pre-eminently the story of one person, the hero,[1] or at most of two, the hero and heroine. Moreover, it is only in the love-tragedies, _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Antony and Cleopatra_, that the heroine is as much the centre of the action as the hero. The rest, including _Macbeth_, are single stars. So that, having noticed the peculiarity of these two dramas, we may henceforth, for the sake of brevity, ignore it, and may speak of the tragic story as being concerned primarily with one person.  The story, next, leads up to, and includes, the _death_ of the hero. On the one hand (whatever may be true of tragedy elsewhere), no play at the end of which the hero remains alive is, in the full Shakespearean sense, a tragedy; and we no longer class _Troilus and Cressida_ or _Cymbeline_ as such, as did the editors of the Folio. On the other hand, the story depicts also the troubled part of the heros life which precedes and leads up to his death; and an instantaneous death occurring by accident in the midst of prosperity would not suffice for it. It is, in fact, essentially a tale of suffering and calamity conducting to death.  The suffering and calamity are, moreover, exceptional. They befall a conspicuous person. They are themselves of some striking kind. They are also, as a rule, unexpected, and contrasted with previous happiness or glory. A tale, for example, of a man slowly worn to death by disease, poverty, little cares, sordid vices, petty persecutions, however piteous or dreadful it might be, would not be tragic in the Shakespearean sense.  Such exceptional suffering and calamity, then, affecting the hero, and--we must now add--generally extending far and wide beyond him, so as to make the whole scene a scene of woe, are an essential ingredient in tragedy and a chief source of the tragic emotions, and especially of pity. But the proportions of this ingredient, and the direction taken by tragic pity, will naturally vary greatly. Pity, for example, has a much larger part in _King Lear_ than in _Macbeth_, and is directed in the one case chiefly to the hero, in the other chiefly to minor characters.  Let us now pause for a moment on the ideas we have so far reached. They would more than suffice to describe the whole tragic fact as it presented itself to the mediaeval mind. To the mediaeval mind a tragedy meant a narrative rather than a play, and its notion of the matter of this narrative may readily be gathered from Dante or, still better, from Chaucer. Chaucers _Monks Tale_ is a'

  const high6 = 'series of what he calls tragedies; and this means in fact a series of tales _de Casibus Illustrium Virorum_,--stories of the Falls of Illustrious Men, such as Lucifer, Adam, Hercules and Nebuchadnezzar. And the Monk ends the tale of Croesus thus:  Anhanged was Cresus, the proudè kyng; His roial tronè myghte hym nat availle. Tragédie is noon oother maner thyng, Ne kan in syngyng criè ne biwaille But for that Fortune alwey wole assaile With unwar strook the regnès that been proude; For whan men trusteth hire, thanne wol she faille, And covere hire brighte facè with a clowde.  A total reverse of fortune, coming unawares upon a man who stood in high degree, happy and apparently secure,--such was the tragic fact to the mediaeval mind. It appealed strongly to common human sympathy and pity; it startled also another feeling, that of fear. It frightened men and awed them. It made them feel that man is blind and helpless, the plaything of an inscrutable power, called by the name of Fortune or some other name,--a power which appears to smile on him for a little, and then on a sudden strikes him down in his pride.  Shakespeares idea of the tragic fact is larger than this idea and goes beyond it; but it includes it, and it is worth while to observe the identity of the two in a certain point which is often ignored. Tragedy with Shakespeare is concerned always with persons of high degree; often with kings or princes; if not, with leaders in the state like Coriolanus, Brutus, Antony; at the least, as in _Romeo and Juliet_, with members of great houses, whose quarrels are of public moment. There is a decided difference here between _Othello_ and our three other tragedies, but it is not a difference of kind. Othello himself is no mere private person; he is the General of the Republic. At the beginning we see him in the Council-Chamber of the Senate. The consciousness of his high position never leaves him. At the end, when he is determined to live no longer, he is as anxious as Hamlet not to be misjudged by the great world, and his last speech begins,  Soft you; a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service, and they know it.[2]  And this characteristic of Shakespeares tragedies, though not the most vital, is neither external nor unimportant. The saying that every death-bed is the scene of the fifth act of a tragedy has its meaning, but it would not be true if the word tragedy bore its dramatic sense. The pangs of despised love and the anguish of remorse, we say, are the same in a peasant and a prince; but, not to insist that they cannot be so when the prince is really a prince, the story of the prince, the triumvir, or the general, has a greatness and dignity of its own. His fate affects the welfare of a whole nation or empire; and when he falls suddenly from the height of earthly greatness to the dust, his fall produces a sense of contrast, of the powerlessness of man, and of the omnipotence--perhaps the caprice--of Fortune or Fate, which no tale of private life can possibly rival.  Such feelings are constantly evoked by Shakespeares tragedies,--again in varying degrees. Perhaps they are the very strongest of the emotions awakened by the early tragedy of _Richard II._, where they receive a concentrated expression in Richards famous speech about the antic Death, who sits in the hollow crown  That rounds the mortal temples of a king,  grinning at his pomp, watching till his vanity and his fancied security have wholly encased him round, and then coming and boring with a little pin through his castle wall. And these feelings, though their predominance is subdued in the mightiest tragedies, remain powerful there. In the figure of the maddened Lear we see  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king;  and if we would realise the truth in this matter we cannot do better than compare with the effect of _King Lear_ the effect of Tourgéniefs parallel and remarkable tale of peasant life, _A King Lear of the Steppes_. 2  A Shakespearean tragedy as so far considered may be called a story of exceptional calamity leading to the death of a man in high estate. But it is clearly much more than this, and we have now to regard it from another side. No amount of calamity which merely befell a man, descending from the clouds like lightning, or stealing from the darkness like pestilence, could alone provide the substance of its story. Job was the greatest of all the children of the east, and his afflictions were well-nigh more than he could bear; but even if we imagined them wearing him to death, that would not make his story tragic. Nor yet would it become so, in the Shakespearean sense, if the fire, and the great wind from the wilderness, and the torments of his flesh were conceived as sent by a supernatural power, whether just or malignant. The calamities of tragedy do not simply happen, nor are they sent; they proceed mainly from actions, and those the actions of men.  We see a number of human beings placed in certain circumstances; and we see, arising from the co-operation of their characters in these circumstances, certain actions. These actions beget others, and these others beget others again, until this series of inter-connected deeds leads by an apparently inevitable sequence to a catastrophe. The effect of such a series on imagination is to make us regard the sufferings which accompany it, and the catastrophe in which it ends, not only or chiefly as something which happens to the persons concerned, but equally as something which is caused by them. This at least may be said of the principal persons, and, among them, of the hero, who always contributes in some measure to the disaster in which he perishes.  This second aspect of tragedy evidently differs greatly from the first. Men, from this point of view, appear to us primarily as agents, themselves the authors of their proper woe; and our fear and pity, though they will not cease or diminish, will be modified accordingly. We are now to consider this second aspect, remembering that it too is only one aspect, and additional to the first, not a substitute for it.  The story or action of a Shakespearean tragedy does not consist, of course, solely of human actions or deeds; but the deeds are the predominant factor. And these deeds are, for the most part, actions in the full sense of the word; not things done tween asleep and wake, but acts or omissions thoroughly expressive of the doer,--characteristic deeds. The centre of the tragedy, therefore, may be said with equal truth to lie in action issuing from character, or in character issuing in action.  Shakespeares main interest lay here. To say that it lay in _mere_ character, or was a psychological interest, would be a great mistake, for he was dramatic to the tips of his fingers. It is possible to find places where he has given a certain indulgence to his love of poetry, and even to his turn for general reflections; but it would be very difficult, and in his later tragedies perhaps impossible, to detect passages where he has allowed such freedom to the interest in character apart from action. But for the opposite extreme, for the abstraction of mere plot (which is a very different thing from the tragic action), for the kind of interest which predominates in a novel like _The Woman in White_, it is clear that he cared even less. I do not mean that this interest is absent from his dramas; but it is subordinate to others, and is so interwoven with them that we are rarely conscious of it apart, and rarely feel in any great strength the half-intellectual, half-nervous excitement of following an ingenious complication. What we do feel strongly, as a tragedy advances to its close, is that the calamities and catastrophe follow inevitably from the deeds of men, and that the main source of these deeds is character. The dictum that, with Shakespeare, character is destiny is no doubt an exaggeration, and one that may mislead (for many of his tragic personages, if they had not met with peculiar'

  const high7 = 'circumstances, would have escaped a tragic end, and might even have lived fairly untroubled lives); but it is the exaggeration of a vital truth.  This truth, with some of its qualifications, will appear more clearly if we now go on to ask what elements are to be found in the story or action, occasionally or frequently, beside the characteristic deeds, and the sufferings and circumstances, of the persons. I will refer to three of these additional factors.At dawn a taxi is called to ferry them through deserted Cambridge streets, up Massachusetts Avenue and past Harvard Yard, to Mount Auburn Hospital. Ashima registers, answering questions about the frequency and duration of the contractions, as Ashoke fills out the forms. She is seated in a wheelchair and pushed through the shining, brightly lit corridors, whisked into an elevator more spacious than her kitchen. On the maternity floor she is assigned to a bed by a window, in a room at the end of the hall. She is asked to remove her Murshidabad silk sari in favor of a flowered cotton gown that, to her mild embarrassment, only reaches her knees. A nurse offers to fold up the sari but, exasperated by the six slippery yards, ends up stuffing the material into Ashimas slate blue suitcase. Her obstetrician, Dr. Ashley, gauntly handsome in a Lord Mountbatten sort of way, with fine sand-colored hair swept back from his temples, arrives to examine her progress. The babys head is in the proper position, has already begun its descent. She is told that she is still in early labor, three centimeters dilated, beginning to efface. What does it mean, dilated? she asks, and Dr. Ashley holds up two fingers side by side, then draws them apart, explaining the unimaginable thing her body must do in order for the baby to pass. The process will take some time, Dr. Ashley tells her; given that this is her first pregnancy, labor can take twenty-four hours, sometimes more. She searches for Ashokes face, but he has stepped behind the curtain the doctor has drawn. Ill be back, Ashoke says to her in 9/295 Bengali, and then a nurse adds: Dont you worry, Mr. Ganguli. Shes got a long ways to go. We can take over from here. Now she is alone, cut off by curtains from the three other women in the room. One womans name, she gathers from bits of conversation, is Beverly. Another is Lois. Carol lies to her left. Goddamnit, goddamn you, this is hell, she hears one of them say. And then a mans voice: I love you, sweetheart. Words Ashima has neither heard nor expects to hear from her own husband; this is not how they are. It is the first time in her life she has slept alone, surrounded by strangers; all her life she has slept either in a room with her parents, or with Ashoke at her side. She wishes the curtains were open, so that she could talk to the American women. Perhaps one of them has given birth before, can tell her what to expect. But she has gathered that Americans, in spite of their public declarations of affection, in spite of their miniskirts and bikinis, in spite of their hand-holding on the street and lying on top of each other on the Cambridge Common, prefer their privacy. She spreads her fingers over the taut, enormous drum her middle has become, wondering where the babys feet and hands are at this moment. The child is no longer restless; for the past few days, apart from the occasional flutter, she has not felt it punch or kick or press against her ribs. She wonders if she is the only Indian person in the hospital, but a gentle twitch from the baby reminds her that she is, technically speaking, not alone. Ashima thinks its strange that her child will be born in a place most people enter either to suffer or to die. There is nothing to comfort her in the off-white tiles of the floor, the off-white panels of the ceiling, the white sheets tucked tightly into the bed. In India, she thinks to herself, women go home to their parents to give birth, away from husbands and in-laws and household cares, retreating briefly to childhood when the baby arrives. Another contraction begins, more violent than the last. She cries out, pressing her head against the pillow. Her fingers grip the chilly rails of the bed. No one hears her, no nurse rushes to her side. She has been instructed to time the duration of the contractions and so she consults her watch, a bon 10/295 voyage gift from her parents, slipped over her wrist the last time she saw them, amid airport confusion and tears. It wasnt until she was on the plane, flying for the first time in her life on a BOAC VC-10 whose deafening ascent twenty-six members of her family had watched from the balcony at Dum Dum Airport, as she was drifting over parts of India shed never set foot in, and then even farther, outside India itself, that shed noticed the watch among the cavalcade of matrimonial bracelets on both her arms: iron, gold, coral, conch. Now, in addition, she wears a plastic bracelet with a typed label identifying her as a patient of the hospital. She keeps the watch face turned to the inside of her wrist. On the back, surrounded by the words waterproof, antimagnetic, and shock-protected, her married initials, A.G., are inscribed. American seconds tick on top of her pulse point. For half a minute, a band of pain wraps around her stomach, radiating toward her back and shooting down her legs. And then, again, relief. She calculates the Indian time on her hands. The tip of her thumb strikes each rung of the brown ladders etched onto the backs of her fingers, then stops at the middle of the third: it is nine and a half hours ahead in Calcutta, already evening, half past eight. In the kitchen of her parents flat on Amherst Street, at this very moment, a servant is pouring after-dinner tea into steaming glasses, arranging Marie biscuits on a tray. Her mother, very soon to be a grandmother, is standing at the mirror of her dressing table, untangling waist-length hair, still more black than gray, with her fingers. Her father hunches over his slanted ink-stained table by the window, sketching, smoking, listening to the Voice of America. Her younger brother, Rana, studies for a physics exam on the bed. She pictures clearly the gray cement floor of her parents sitting room, feels its solid chill underfoot even on the hottest days. An enormous black-and-white photograph of her deceased paternal grandfather looms at one end against the pink plaster wall; opposite, an alcove shielded by clouded panes of glass is stuffed with books and papers and her fathers watercolor tins. For an instant the weight of the baby vanishes, replaced by the scene that passes before her eyes, only to be replaced once more by a blue strip of the Charles River, thick green treetops, cars gliding up and down Memorial Drive. 11/295 In Cambridge it is eleven in the morning, already lunchtime in the hospitals accelerated day. A tray holding warm apple juice, Jell-O, ice cream, and cold baked chicken is brought to her side. Patty, the friendly nurse with the diamond engagement ring and a fringe of reddish hair beneath her cap, tells Ashima to consume only the Jell-O and the apple juice. Its just as well. Ashima would not have touched the chicken, even if permitted; Americans eat their chicken in its skin, though Ashima has recently found a kind butcher on Prospect Street willing to pull it off for her. Patty comes to fluff the pillows, tidy the bed. Dr. Ashley pokes in his head from time to time. No need to worry, he chirps, putting a stethoscope to Ashimas belly, patting her hand, admiring her various bracelets. Everything is looking perfectly normal. We are expecting a perfectly normal delivery, Mrs. Ganguli. But nothing feels normal to Ashima. For the past eighteen months, ever since shes arrived in Cambridge, nothing has felt normal at all. Its not so much the pain, which she knows, somehow, she will survive. Its the consequence: motherhood in a foreign land. For it was one thing to be pregnant, to suffer the queasy mornings in bed, the sleepless nights, the dull throbbing in her back, the countless visits to the bathroom. Throughout the experience, in spite of her growing discomfort, shed been astonished by her bodys ability to make life, exactly as her mother and grandmother and all her greatgrandmothers had done. That it was happening so far from home, unmonitored and unobserved by those she loved, had made it more miraculous still. But she is terrified to raise a child in a country where she is related to no one, where she knows so little, where life seems so tentative and spare. How about a little walk? It might do you good, Patty asks when she comes to clear the lunch tray. Ashima looks up from a tattered copy of Desh magazine that shed brought to read on her plane ride to Boston and still cannot bring herself to throw away. The printed pages of Bengali type, slightly rough to the touch, are a perpetual comfort to her. Shes read each of the short stories and poems 12/295 and articles a dozen times. There is a pen-and-ink drawing on page eleven by her father, an illustrator for the magazine: a view of the North Calcutta skyline sketched from the roof of their flat one foggy January morning. She had stood behind her father as hed drawn it, watching as he crouched over his easel, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his shoulders wrapped in a black Kashmiri shawl. Yes, all right, Ashima says. Patty helps Ashima out of bed, tucks her feet one by one into slippers, drapes a second nightgown around her shoulders. Just think, Patty says as Ashima struggles to stand. In a day or two youll be half the size. She takes Ashimas arm as they step out of the room, into the hallway. After a few feet Ashima stops, her legs trembling as another wave of pain surges through her body. She shakes her head, her eyes filling with tears. I cannot. You can. Squeeze my hand. Squeeze as tight as you like. After a minute they continue on, toward the nurses station. Hoping for a boy or a girl? Patty asks. As long as there are ten finger and ten toe, Ashima replies. For these anatomical details, these particular signs of life, are the ones she has the most difficulty picturing when she imagines the baby in her arms. Patty smiles, a little too widely, and suddenly Ashima realizes her error, knows she should have said fingers and toes. This error pains her almost as much as her last contraction. English had been her subject. In Calcutta, before she was married, she was working toward a college degree. She used to tutor neighborhood schoolchildren in their homes, on their verandas and beds, helping them to memorize Tennyson and Wordsworth, to pronounce words like sign and cough, to understand the difference between Aristotelian and Shakespearean tragedy. But in Bengali, a finger can also mean fingers, a toe toes. 13/295 It had been after tutoring one day that Ashimas mother had met her at the door, told her to go straight to the bedroom and prepare herself; a man was waiting to see her. He was the third in as many months. The first had been a widower with four children. The second, a newspaper cartoonist who knew her father, had been hit by a bus in Esplanade and lost his left arm. To her great relief they had both rejected her. She was nineteen, in the middle of her studies, in no rush to be a bride. And so, obediently but without expectation, she had untangled and rebraided her hair, wiped away the kohl that had smudged below her eyes, patted some Cuticura powder from a velvet puff onto her skin. The sheer parrot green sari she pleated and tucked into her petticoat had been laid out for her on the bed by her mother. Before entering the sitting room, Ashima had paused in the corridor. She could hear her mother saying, She is fond of cooking, and she can knit extremely well. Within a week she finished this cardigan I am wearing. Ashima smiled, amused by her mothers salesmanship; it had taken her the better part of a year to finish the cardigan, and still her mother had had to do the sleeves. Glancing at the floor where visitors customarily removed their slippers, she noticed, beside two sets of chappals, a pair of mens shoes that were not like any shed ever seen on the streets and trams and buses of Calcutta, or even in the windows of Bata. They were brown shoes with black heels and off-white laces and stitching. There was a band of lentil-sized holes embossed on either side of each shoe, and at the tips was a pretty pattern pricked into the leather as if with a needle. Looking more closely, she saw the shoemakers name written on the insides, in gold lettering that had all but faded: something and sons, it said. She saw the size, eight and a half, and the initials U.S.A. And as her mother continued to sing her praises, Ashima, unable to resist a sudden and overwhelming urge, stepped into the shoes at her feet. Lingering sweat from the owners feet mingled with hers, causing her heart to race; it was the closest thing she had ever experienced to the touch of a man. The leather was creased, heavy, and still warm. On the left shoe she had noticed that one of the crisscrossing laces had missed a hole, and this oversight set her at ease. 14/295 She extracted her feet, entered the room. The man was sitting in a rattan chair, his parents perched on the edge of the twin bed where her brother slept at night. He was slightly plump, scholarly-looking but still youthful, with black thick-framed glasses and a sharp, prominent nose. A neatly trimmed mustache connected to a beard that covered only his chin lent him an elegant, vaguely aristocratic air. He wore brown socks and brown trousers and a green-and-white-striped shirt and was staring glumly at his knees. He did not look up when she appeared. Though she was aware of his gaze as she crossed the room, by the time she managed to steal another look at him he was once again indifferent, focused on his knees. He cleared his throat as if to speak but then said nothing. Instead it was his father who did the talking, saying that the man had gone to St. Xaviers, and then B.E. College, graduating first-class-first from both institutions. Ashima took her seat and smoothed the pleats of her sari. She sensed the mother eyeing her with approval. Ashima was five feet four inches, tall for a Bengali woman, ninetynine pounds. Her complexion was on the dark side of fair, but she had been compared on more than one occasion to the actress Madhabi Mukherjee. Her nails were admirably long, her fingers, like her fathers, artistically slim. They inquired after her studies and she was asked to recite a few stanzas from The Daffodils. The mans family lived in Alipore. The father was a labor officer for the customs department of a shipping company. My son has been living abroad for two years, the mans father said, earning a Ph.D. in Boston, researching in the field of fiber optics. Ashima had never heard of Boston, or of fiber optics. She was asked whether she was willing to fly on a plane and then if she was capable of living in a city characterized by severe, snowy winters, alone. Wont he be there? shed asked, pointing to the man whose shoes shed briefly occupied, but who had yet to say a word to her. It was only after the betrothal that shed learned his name. One week later the invitations were printed, and two weeks after that she was adorned and 15/295 adjusted by countless aunts, countless cousins hovering around her. These were her last moments as Ashima Bhaduri, before becoming Ashima Ganguli. Her lips were darkened, her brow and cheeks dotted with sandalwood paste, her hair wound up, bound with flowers, held in place by a hundred wire pins that would take an hour to remove once the wedding was finally over. Her head was draped with scarlet netting. The air was damp, and in spite of the pins Ashimas hair, thickest of all the cousins, would not lie flat. She wore all the necklaces and chokers and bracelets that were destined to live most of their lives in an extra-large safety deposit box in a bank vault in New England. At the designated hour she was seated on a piri that her father had decorated, hoisted five feet off the ground, carried out to'

  const high8 = 'meet the groom. She had hidden her face with a heart-shaped betel leaf, kept her head bent low until she had circled him seven times. Eight thousand miles away in Cambridge, she has come to know him. In the evenings she cooks for him, hoping to please, with the unrationed, remarkably unblemished sugar, flour, rice, and salt she had written about to her mother in her very first letter home. By now she has learned that her husband likes his food on the salty side, that his favorite thing about lamb curry is the potatoes, and that he likes to finish his dinner with a small final helping of rice and dal. At night, lying beside her in bed, he listens to her describe the events of her day: her walks along Massachusetts Avenue, the shops she visits, the Hare Krishnas who pester her with their leaflets, the pistachio ice cream cones she treats herself to in Harvard Square. In spite of his meager graduate student wages he sets aside money to send every few months to his father to help put an extension on his parents house. He is fastidious about his clothing; their first argument had been over a sweater shed shrunk in the washing machine. As soon as he comes home from the university the first thing he does is hang up his shirt and trousers, donning a pair of drawstring pajamas and a pullover if its cold. On Sundays he spends an hour occupied with his tins of shoe polishes and his three pairs of shoes, two black and one brown. The brown ones are the ones hed been wearing when hed first come to see her. The sight of him cross-legged on newspapers spread on the floor, 16/295 intently whisking a brush over the leather, always reminds her of her indiscretion in her parents corridor. It is a moment that shocks her still, and that she prefers, in spite of all she tells him at night about the life they now share, to keep to herself. On another floor of the hospital, in a waiting room, Ashoke hunches over a Boston Globe from a month ago, abandoned on a neighboring chair. He reads about the riots that took place during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and about Dr. Benjamin Spock, the baby doctor, being sentenced to two years in jail for threatening to counsel draft evaders. The Favre Leuba strapped to his wrist is running six minutes ahead of the large gray-faced clock on the wall. It is four-thirty in the morning. An hour before, Ashoke had been fast asleep, at home, Ashimas side of the bed covered with exams hed been grading late at night, when the telephone rang. Ashima was fully dilated and being taken to the delivery room, the person on the other end had said. Upon arrival at the hospital he was told that she was pushing, that it could be any minute now. Any minute. And yet it seemed only the other day, one steel-colored winters morning when the windows of the house were being pelted with hail, that she had spit out her tea, accusing him of mistaking the salt for sugar. To prove himself right he had taken a sip of the sweet liquid from her cup, but she had insisted on its bitterness, and poured it down the sink. That was the first thing that had caused her to suspect, and then the doctor had confirmed it, and then he would wake to the sounds, every morning when she went to brush her teeth, of her retching. Before he left for the university he would leave a cup of tea by the side of the bed, where she lay listless and silent. Often, returning in the evenings, he would find her still lying there, the tea untouched. He now desperately needs a cup of tea for himself, not having managed to make one before leaving the house. But the machine in the corridor 17/295 dispenses only coffee, tepid at best, in paper cups. He takes off his thickrimmed glasses, fitted by a Calcutta optometrist, polishes the lenses with the cotton handkerchief he always keeps in his pocket, A for Ashoke embroidered by his mother in light blue thread. His black hair, normally combed back neatly from his forehead, is disheveled, sections of it on end. He stands and begins pacing as the other expectant fathers do. So far, the door to the waiting room has opened twice, and a nurse has announced that one of them has a boy or a girl. There are handshakes all around, pats on the back, before the father is escorted away. The men wait with cigars, flowers, address books, bottles of champagne. They smoke cigarettes, ashing onto the floor. Ashoke is indifferent to such indulgences. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol of any kind. Ashima is the one who keeps all their addresses, in a small notebook she carries in her purse. It has never occurred to him to buy his wife flowers. He returns to the Globe, still pacing as he reads. A slight limp causes Ashokes right foot to drag almost imperceptibly with each step. Since childhood he has had the habit and the ability to read while walking, holding a book in one hand on his way to school, from room to room in his parents three-story house in Alipore, and up and down the red clay stairs. Nothing roused him. Nothing distracted him. Nothing caused him to stumble. As a teenager he had gone through all of Dickens. He read newer authors as well, Graham Greene and Somerset Maugham, all purchased from his favorite stall on College Street with pujo money. But most of all he loved the Russians. His paternal grandfather, a former professor of European literature at Calcutta University, had read from them aloud in English translations when Ashoke was a boy. Each day at tea time, as his brothers and sisters played kabadi and cricket outside, Ashoke would go to his grandfathers room, and for an hour his grandfather would read supine on the bed, his ankles crossed and the book propped open on his chest, Ashoke curled at his side. For that hour Ashoke was deaf and blind to the world around him. He did not hear his brothers and sisters laughing on the rooftop, or see the tiny, dusty, cluttered room in which his grandfather read. Read all the Russians, and then reread them, his 18/295 grandfather had said. They will never fail you. When Ashokes English was good enough, he began to read the books himself. It was while walking on some of the worlds noisiest, busiest streets, on Chowringhee and Gariahat Road, that he had read pages of The Brothers Karamazov, and Anna Karenina, and Fathers and Sons. Once, a younger cousin who had tried to imitate him had fallen down the red clay staircase in Ashokes house and broken an arm. Ashokes mother was always convinced that her eldest son would be hit by a bus or a tram, his nose deep into War and Peace. That he would be reading a book the moment he died. One day, in the earliest hours of October 20, 1961, this nearly happened. Ashoke was twenty-two, a student at B.E. College. He was traveling on the 83 Up Howrah-Ranchi Express to visit his grandparents for the holidays; they had moved from Calcutta to Jamshedpur upon his grandfathers retirement from the university. Ashoke had never spent the holidays away from his family. But his grandfather had recently gone blind, and he had requested Ashokes company specifically, to read him The Statesman in the morning, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy in the afternoon. Ashoke accepted the invitation eagerly. He carried two suitcases, the first one containing clothes and gifts, the second empty. For it would be on this visit, his grandfather had said, that the books in his glass-fronted case, collected over a lifetime and preserved under lock and key, would be given to Ashoke. The books had been promised to Ashoke throughout his childhood, and for as long as he could remember he had coveted them more than anything else in the world. He had already received a few in recent years, given to him on birthdays and other special occasions. But now that the day had come to inherit the rest, a day his grandfather could no longer read the books himself, Ashoke was saddened, and as he placed the empty suitcase under his seat, he was disconcerted by its weightlessness, regretful of the circumstances that would cause it, upon his'

He carried a single volume for the journey, a hardbound collection of short stories by Nikolai Gogol, which his grandfather had given him when 19/295 hed graduated from class twelve. On the title page, beneath his grandfathers signature, Ashoke had written his own. Because of Ashokes passion for this particular book, the spine had recently split, threatening to divide the pages into two sections. His favorite story in the book was the last, The Overcoat, and that was the one Ashoke had begun to reread as the train pulled out of Howrah Station late in the evening with a prolonged and deafening shriek, away from his parents and his six younger brothers and sisters, all of whom had come to see him off and had huddled until the last moment by the window, waving to him from the long dusky platform. He had read The Overcoat too many times to count, certain sentences and phrases embedded in his memory. Each time he was captivated by the absurd, tragic, yet oddly inspiring story of Akaky Akakyevich, the impoverished main character who spends his life meekly copying documents written by others and suffering the ridicule of absolutely everyone. His heart went out to poor Akaky, a humble clerk just as Ashokes father had been at the start of his career. Each time, reading the account of Akakys christening, and the series of queer names his mother had rejected, Ashoke laughed aloud. He shuddered at the description of the tailor Petrovichs big toe, with its deformed nail as thick and hard as the shell of a tortoise. His mouth watered at the cold veal and cream pastries and champagne Akaky consumed the night his precious coat was stolen, in spite of the fact that Ashoke had never tasted these things himself. Ashoke was always devastated when Akaky was robbed in a square that looked to him like a dreadful desert, leaving him cold and vulnerable, and Akakys death, some pages later, never failed to bring tears to his eyes. In some ways the story made less sense each time he read it, the scenes he pictured so vividly, and absorbed so fully, growing more elusive and profound. Just as Akakys ghost haunted the final pages, so did it haunt a place deep in Ashokes soul, shedding light on all that was irrational, all that was inevitable about the world. Outside the Whats the matter with him? Sammy said. He slid over until his shoulders touched cold plaster. He was careful to take both of the pillows with him. Is he sick? What do you think? said his mother, slapping now at the vacated expanse of bedsheet, as if to scatter any offending particles of himself that Sammy might have left behind. She had just come home from her last night on a two-week graveyard rotation at Bellevue, where she worked as a psychiatric nurse. The stale breath of the hospital was on her, but the open throat of her uniform gave off a faint whiff of the lavender water in which she bathed her tiny frame. The natural fragrance of her body was a spicy, angry smell like fresh pencil shavings. He can barely stand on his own two feet Sammy peered over his mother, trying to get a better look at poor Josef Kavalier in his baggy wool suit. He had known, dimly, that he had Czech cousins. But his mother had not said a word about any of them coming to visit, let alone to share Sammys bed. He wasnt sure just how San Francisco fitted in to the story. There you are, his mother said, standing up straight again, apparently satisfied at having driven Sammy onto the easternmost five inches of the mattress. She turned to Josef Kavalier. Come here. I want to tell you something. She grabbed hold of his ears as if taking a jug by the handles, and crushed each of his cheeks in turn with her lips. You made it. All right? Youre here. All right, said her nephew. He did not sound unconvinced. She handed him a washcloth and went out. As soon as she left, Sammy reclaimed a few precious inches of mattress while his cousin stood there, rubbing at his mauled cheeks. After a moment, Mrs. Klayman switched off the light in the kitchen, and they were left in darkness. Sammy heard his cousin take a deep breath and slowly let it out The stack of newsprint rattled and then hit the floor with a heavy thud of defeat. His jacket buttons clicked against the back of a chair; his trousers rustled as he stepped out of them; he let fall one shoe, then the other. His wristwatch chimed against the water glass on the nightstand. Then he and a gust of chilly air got in under the covers, bearing with them an odor of cigarette, armpit, damp wool, and something sweet and somehow nostalgic that Sammy presently identified as the smell, on his cousins breath, of prunes from the leftover ingot of his mothers special meatloaf--prunes were only a small part of what made it so very special--which he had seen her wrap like a parcel in a sheet of wax paper and set on a plate in the Frigidaire. So she had known that her nephew would be arriving tonight, had even been expecting him for supper, and had said nothing about it to Sammy. Josef Kavalier settled back against the mattress, cleared his throat once, tucked his arms under his head, and then, as if he had been unplugged, stopped moving. He neither tossed nor fidgeted nor even so much as flexed a toe. The Big Ben on the nightstand ticked loudly. Josefs breathing thickened and slowed. Sammy was just wondering if anyone could possibly fall asleep with such abandon when his cousin spoke. As soon as I can fetch some money, I will find a lodging, and leave the bed, he said. His accent was vaguely German, furrowed with an odd Scots pleat. That would be nice, Sammy said. You speak good English. Thank you Whered you learn it? I prefer not to say. Its a secret? It is a personal matter. Can you tell me what you were doing in California? said Sammy. Or is that confidential information too? I was crossing over from Japan Japan Sammy was sick with envy. He had never gone farther on his soda-straw legs than Buffalo, never undertaken any crossing more treacherous than the flatulent poison-green ribbon that separated Brooklyn from Manhattan Island. In that narrow bed, in that bedroom hardly wider than the bed itself, at the back of an apartment in a solidly lower-middle-class building on Ocean Avenue, with his grandmothers snoring shaking the walls like a passing trolley, Sammy dreamed the usual Brooklyn dreams of flight and transformation and escape. He dreamed with fierce contrivance, transmuting himself into a major American novelist, or a famous smart person, like Clifton Fadiman, or perhaps into a heroic doctor; or developing, through practice and sheer force of will, the mental powers that would give him a preternatural control over the hearts and minds of men. In his desk drawer lay--and had lain for some time--the first eleven pages of a massive autobiographical novel to be entitled either (in the Perelmanian mode) Through Abe Glass, Darkly or (in the Dreiserian) American Disillusionment(a subject of which he was still by and large ignorant). He had devoted an embarrassing number of hours of mute concentration--brow furrowed, breath held--to the development of his brains latent powers of telepathy and mind control. And he had thrilled to that Iliad of medical heroics, The Microbe Hunters, ten times at least. But like most natives of Brooklyn, Sammy considered himself a realist, and in general his escape plans centered around the attainment of fabulous sums of money.rom the age of six, he had sold seeds, candy bars, houseplants, cleaning fluids, metal polish, magazine subscriptions, unbreakable combs, and shoelaces door-to-door. In a Zharkovs laboratory on the kitchen table, he had invented almost functional button-reattachers, tandem bottle openers, and heatless clothes irons. In more recent years, Sammys commercial attention had been arrested by the field of professional illustration. The great commercial illustrators and cartoonists--Rockwell, Leyendecker, Raymond, Caniff--were at their zenith, and there was a general impression abroad that, at the drawing board, a man could not only make a good living but alter the very texture and tone of the national mood. In Sammys closet were stacked dozens of pads of coarse newsprint, filled with horses, Indians, football heroes, sentient apes, Fokkers, nymphs, moon rockets, buckaroos, Saracens, tropic jungles, grizzlies, studies of the folds in womens clothing, the dents in mens hats, the lights in human irises, clouds in the western sky. His grasp of perspective was tenuous, his knowledge of human anatomy dubious, his line often sketchy--but he was an enterprising thief. He clipped favorite pages and panels out of newspapers and comic books and pasted them into a fat notebook: a thousand different exemplary poses and styles. He had made extensive use of his bible of clippings in concocting a counterfeit Terry and the Pirates strip called South China Sea, drawn in faithful imitation of the great Caniff. He had knocked off Raymond in something he called Pimpernel of the Planets, and Chester Gould in a lockjawed G-man strip called Knuckle Duster Doyle. He had tried swiping from Hogarth and Lee Falk, from George Herriman, Harold Gray, and Elzie Segar. He kept his sample strips in a fat cardboard portfolio under his bed, waiting for an opportunity, for his main chance, to present itself. Japan he said again, reeling at the exotic Caniffian perfume that hung over the name. What were you doing there? Mostly I was suffering from the intestinal complaint, Josef Kavalier said. and I suffer still. Particular in the night. Sammy pondered this information for a moment, then moved a little nearer to the wall. Tell me, Samuel, Josef Kavalier said. How many examples must I have in my portfolio? Not Samuel. Sammy. No, call me Sam. Sam. What portfolio is that? My portfolio of drawings. To show your employer. Sadly, I am obligated to leave behind all of my work in Prague, but I can very quickly do much more that will be frightfully good. To show my boss? Sammy said, sensing in his own confusion the persistent trace of his mothers handiwork. What are you talking about? Your mother suggested that you might to help me get a job in the company where you work. I am an artist, like you. An artist. Again Sammy envied his cousin. This was statement he himself would never have been able to utter without lowering his fraudulent gaze to his show tops. My mother told you I was an artist? A commercial artist, yes. For the Empire Novelties Incorporated Company. For an instant Sammy cupped the tiny flame this secondhand compliment lit within him. Then he blew it out. She was talking through her hat, he said. Sorry? She was full of it. Full of...? Im an inventory clerk. Sometimes they let me do pasteup for an ad. Or when they add a new item to the line, I get to do the illustration. For that, they pay me two dollars per. Ah. Josef Kavalier let out another long breath. He still had not moved a muscle. Sammy couldnt decide if this apparent utter motionlessness was the product of unbearable tension or a marvelous calm. She wrote a letter to my father, Josef tried. I remember she said you create designs of superb new inventions and devices.Guess what? She talked into her hat. Sammy sighed, as if to suggest that this was unfortunately the case; a regretful sigh, long-suffering---and false. No doubt, his mother writing to her brother in Prague, had believed that she was making an accurate report; it was Sammy who had been talking through his hat for the last year, embroidering, not only for her benefit but to anyone who would listen, the menial nature of his position at Empire Novelties. Sammy was briefly embarrassed, not so much at being caught out and having to confess his lowly status to his cousin, as at this evidence of a flaw in the omniscient maternal loupe. Then he wondered if his mother, far from being hoodwinked by his boasting, had not in fact been counting on his having grossly exaggerated the degree of his influence over Sheldon Anapol, the owner of Empire Novelties. If he were to keep up the pretense to which he had devoted so much wind and invention, then he was all but obliged to come home from work tomorrow night clutching a job for Josef Kavalier in his grubby little stock clerks fingers. Ill try, he said, and it was then that he felt the first spark, the tickling finger of possibility along his spine. For another long while, neither of them spoke. This time, Sammy could feel that Josef was still awake, could almost hear the capillary trickle of doubt seeping in, weighing the kid down. Sammy felt sorry for him. Can I ask you a question? he said. Ask me what? What was with all the newspapers? They are your New York newspapers. I bought them at the Grand Central Station. How many? For the first time, he noticed, Josef Kavalier twitched. Eleven.'

const high10 = 'Sammy quickly calculated on his ringers: there were eight metropolitan dailies. Ten if you counted the Eagle and the Home News. Im missing one. Missing...? Times, Herald Tribune, he touched two fingertips, World-Telegram, Journal-American, Sun. He switched hands. News, Post. Uh, Wall Street Journal. And the Brooklyn Eagle. And the Home News in the Bronx. He dropped his hands to the mattress. Whats eleven? The Womans Daily Wearing. Womens Wear Daily? I didnt know it was like that. For the garments. He laughed at himself, a series of brief, throat-clearing rasps. I was looking for something about Prague. Did you find anything? They must have had something in the Times. Something. A little. Nothing about the Jews. The Jews, said Sammy, beginning to understand. It wasnt the latest diplomatic maneuverings in London and Berlin, or the most recent bit of brutal posturing by Adolf Hitler, that Josef was hoping to get news of. He was looking for an item detailing the condition of the Kavalier family. You know Jewish? Yiddish. You know it? No. Thats too bad. We got four Jewish newspapers in New York. Theyd probably have something. What about German newspapers? I dont know, but Id imagine so. We certainly have a lot of Germans. Theyve been marching and having rallies all over town. I see. Youre worried about your family? There was no reply. They couldnt get out? No. Not yet Sammy felt Josef give his head a sharp shake, as if to end the discussion. I find I have smoked all my cigarettes, he went on, in a neutral, phrase-book tone. Perhaps you could- You know, I smoked my last one before bed, said Sammy. Hey, howd you know I smoke? Do I smell? Sammy, his mother called, sleep. Sammy sniffed himself. Huh. I wonder if Ethel can smell it. She doesnt like it. I want to smoke, Ive got to go out the window, there, onto the fire escape. No smoking in bed, Josef said. The more reason then for me to leave it. You dont have to tell me, Sammy said. Im dying to have a place of my own. They lay there for a few minutes, longing for cigarettes and for all the things that this longing, in its perfect frustration, seemed to condense and embody. Your ash holder, Josef said finally. Ashtray On the fire escape. Its a plant It might be filled with the ... spacek? ... kippe? ... the stubbles? The butts, you mean? The butts. Yeah, I guess. Dont tell me youd smoke- Without warning, in a kind of kinetic discharge of activity that seemed to be both the counterpart and the product of the state of perfect indolence that had immediately preceded it, Josef rolled over and out of the bed. Sammys eyes had by now adjusted to the darkness of his room, which was always, at any rate, incomplete. A selvage of gray-blue radiation from the kitchen tube fringed the bedroom door and mingled with a pale shaft of nocturnal Brooklyn, a compound derived from the haloes of streetlights, the headlamps of trolleys and cars, the fires of the boroughs three active steel mills, and the shed luster of the island kingdom to the west, that came slanting in through a parting in the curtains. In this faint glow that was, to Sammy, the sickly steady light of insomnia itself, he could see his cousin going methodically through the pockets of the clothes he had earlier hung so carefully from the back of the chair. The lamp? Josef whispered. Sammy shook his head. The mother, he said. Josef came back to the bed and sat down. Then we must to work in the darkness. He held between the first fingers of his left hand a pleated leaf of cigarette paper. Sammy understood. He sat up on one arm, and with the other tugged the curtains apart, slowly so as not to produce the telltale creak. Then, gritting his teeth, he raised the sash of the window beside his bed, letting in a chilly hum of traffic and a murmuring blast of cold March midnight. Sammys ashtray was an oblong terra-cotta pot, vaguely Mexican, filled with a sterile compound of potting soil and soot and the semipetrified skeleton, appropriately enough, of a cineraria that had gone unsold during Sammys houseplant days and thus predated his smoking habit, still a fairly recent acquisition, by about three years. A dozen stubbed-out ends of Old Golds squirmed around the base of the withered plant, and Sammy distastefully plucked a handful of them--they were slightly damp--as if gathering night crawlers, then handed them in to his cousin, who traded him for a box of matches that evocatively encouraged him to EAT AT JOES CRAB ON FISHERMANS WHARF, in which only one match remained. Quickly, but not without a certain showiness, Josef split open seven butts, one-handed, and tipped the resultant mass of pulpy threads into the wrinkled scrap of Zig Zag. After half a minutes work, he had manufactured them a smoke. Come, he said. He walked on his knees across the bed to the window, where Sammy joined him, and they wriggled through the sash and thrust their heads and upper bodies out of the building. He handed the cigarette to Sammy and, in the precious flare of the match, as Sammy nervously sheltered it from the wind, he saw that Josef had prestidigitated a perfect cylinder, as thick and straight and nearly as smooth as if rolled by machine. Sammy took a long drag of True Virginia Flavor and then passed the magic cigarette back to its crafter, and they smoked it in silence, until only a hot quarter inch remained. Then they climbed back inside, lowered the sash and the blinds, and lay back, bedmates, reeking of smoke. You know, Sammy said, were, uh, weve all been really worried ... about Hitler... and the way hes treating the Jews and ... and all that. When they, when you were ... invaded.... My mom was ... we all... He shook his own head, not sure what he was trying to say. Here. He sat up a little, and tugged one of the pillows out from under the back of his head. I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received. I am in here. Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine conference table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans - of Admissions, Academic Affairs, Athletic Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom. I believe I appear neutral, maybe even pleasant, though Ive been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile. I have committed to crossing my legs I hope carefully, ankle on knee, hands together in the lap of my slacks. My fingers are mated into a mirrored series of what manifests, to me, as the letter X. The interview rooms other personnel include: the Universitys Director of Composition, its varsity tennis coach, and Academy prorector Mr. A. deLint. C.T. is beside me; the others sit, stand and stand, respectively, at the periphery of my focus. The tennis coach jingles pocket-change. There is something vaguely digestive about the rooms odor. The high-traction sole of my complimentary Nike sneaker runs parallel to the wobbling loafer of my mothers half-brother, here in his capacity as Headmaster, sitting in the chair to what I hope is my immediate right, also facing Deans. The Dean at left, a lean yellowish man whose fixed smile nevertheless has the impermanent quality of something stamped into uncooperative material, is a personality-type Ive come lately to appreciate, the type who delays need of any response from me by relating my side of the story for me, to me. Passed a packet of computer sheets by the shaggy lion of a Dean at center, he is peaking more or less to these pages, smiling down. It turned out that there was something terribly stressful about visual telephone interfaces that hadnt been stressful at all about voice-only interfaces. Videophone consumers seemed suddenly to realize that theyd been subject to an insidious but wholly marvelous delusion about conventional voice-only telephony. Theyd never noticed it before, the delusion— its like it was so emotionally complex that it could be countenanced only in the context of its loss. Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting you not to have to pay anything even close to complete attention to her. A traditional aural-only conversation— utilizing a hand-held phone whose earpiece contained only 6 little pinholes but whose mouthpiece (rather significantly, it later seemed) contained (62) or 36 little pinholes— let you enter a kind of highway-hypnotic semi-attentive fugue: while conversing, you could look around the room, doodle, fine-groom, peel tiny bits of dead skin away from your cuticles, compose phone-pad haiku, stir things on the stove; you could even carry on a whole separate additional sign-language-and-exaggerated-facial-expression type of conversation with people right there in the room with you, all while seeming to be right there attending closely to the voice on the phone. And yet— and this was the retrospectively marvelous part— even as you were dividing your attention between the phone call and all sorts of other idle little fuguelike activities, you were somehow never haunted by the suspicion that the person on the other ends attention might be similarly divided. During a traditional call, e.g., as you lets say performed a close tactile blemish-scan of your chin, you were in no way oppressed by the thought that your phonemate was perhaps also devoting a good percentage of her attention to a close tactile blemish-scan. It was an illusion and the illusion was aural and aurally supported: the phone-lines other ends voice was dense, tightly compressed, and vectored right into your ear, enabling you to imagine that the voices owners attention was similarly compressed and focused  even though your own attention was not, was the thing. This bilateral illusion of unilateral attention was almost infantilely gratifying from an emotional standpoint: you got to believe you were receiving somebodys complete attention without having to return it. Regarded with the objectivity of hindsight, the illusion appears arational, almost literally fantastic: it would be like being able both to lie and to trust other people at the same time. Video telephony rendered the fantasy insupportable. Callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest, slightly overintense listeners expression they had to compose for in-person exchanges. Those callers who out of unconscious habit succumbed to fuguelike doodling or pants-crease-adjustment now came off looking rude, absentminded, or childishly self-absorbed. Callers who even more unconsciously blemish-scanned or nostril-explored looked up to find horrified expressions on the video-faces at the other end. All of which resulted in videophonic stress.And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.  God in Heaven he thought.  It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four oclock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his bosss anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five oclock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregors not being there a long time ago.  The office assistant was the bosss man, spineless, and with no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctors recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And whats more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.  He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  Gregor, somebody called - it was his mother - its quarter to seven. Didnt you want to go somewhere?  That gentle voice Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had'

const high11 = 'before.  As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, Im getting up now.  The change in Gregors voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. Gregor, Gregor, he called, whats wrong?  And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: Gregor Gregor  At the other side door his sister came plaintively: Gregor? Arent you well? Do you need anything?  Gregor answered to both sides: Im ready, now, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.  The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.  It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully.  This is something that cant be done in bed, Gregor said to himself, so dont keep trying to do it.  The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.  So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.  It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him.  Seven oclock, already, he said to himself when the clock struck again, seven oclock, and theres still a fog like this.  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.  But then he said to himself: Before it strikes quarter past seven Ill definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask whats happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven oclock.  And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.  When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.  After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. Thatll be someone from work, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet. Theyre not opening the door, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maids firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear the visitors first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the chief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldnt get out of bed if he didnt spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasnt really a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregors back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.  Somethings fallen down in there, said the chief clerk in the room on the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerks firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregors sister whispered to him to let him know: Gregor, the chief clerk is here.  Yes, I know, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.  Gregor, said his father now from the room to his left, the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didnt leave on the early train.  We dont know what to say to him.  And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  Im sure hell be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room. Then the chief clerk called Good morning,  Mr. Samsa. He isnt well, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door.  He isnt well, please believe me.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train The lad only ever thinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; hes been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw.  Hes made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, youll be amazed how nice it is; its hanging up in his room; youll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, Im glad youre here; we wouldnt have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; hes so stubborn; and Im sure he isnt well, he said this morning that he is, but he isnt.  Ill be there in a moment, said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation.  Well I cant think of any other way of explaining it,  Mrs. Samsa, said the chief clerk, I hope its nothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.  Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again.  No, said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.  So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying.  But the others didnt know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour. No expense'

const high12 = 'had been spared on the setting, which was acknowledged to be very beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the Opera houses of Paris and Vienna.  The foreground, to the footlights, was covered with emerald green cloth.  In the middle distance symmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed the base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink and red roses.  Gigantic pansies, considerably larger than the roses, and closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female parishioners for fashionable clergymen, sprang from the moss beneath the rose-trees; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch flowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbanks far-off prodigies. In the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson, in white cashmere slashed with pale blue satin, a reticule dangling from a blue girdle, and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her muslin chemisette, listened with downcast eyes to M. Capouls impassioned wooing, and affected a guileless incomprehension of his designs whenever, by word or glance, he persuasively indicated the ground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from the right wing.  The darling thought Newland Archer, his glance flitting back to the young girl with the lilies-of-the-valley.  She doesnt even guess what its all about. And he contemplated her absorbed young face with a thrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation was mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity.  Well read Faust together ... by the Italian lakes ... he thought, somewhat hazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the masterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to reveal to his bride.  It was only that afternoon that May Welland had let him guess that she cared (New Yorks consecrated phrase of maiden avowal), and already his imagination, leaping ahead of the engagement ring, the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin, pictured her at his side in some scene of old European witchery.  He did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Newland Archer to be a simpleton.  He meant her (thanks to his enlightening companionship) to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the younger set, in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it.  If he had probed to the bottom of his vanity (as he sometimes nearly did) he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years; without, of course, any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy beings life, and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter.  How this miracle of fire and ice was to be created, and to sustain itself in a harsh world, he had never taken the time to think out; but he was content to hold his view without analysing it, since he knew it was that of all the carefully-brushed, white-waistcoated, button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box, exchanged friendly greetings with him, and turned their opera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system.  In matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old New York gentility; he had probably read more, thought more, and even seen a good deal more of the world, than any other man of the number. Singly they betrayed their inferiority; but grouped together they represented New York, and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral.  He instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesome--and also rather bad form--to strike out for himself.  Well--upon my soul exclaimed Lawrence Lefferts, turning his opera-glass abruptly away from the stage.  Lawrence Lefferts was, on the whole, the foremost authority on form in New York.  He had probably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this intricate and fascinating question; but study alone could not account for his complete and easy competence.  One had only to look at him, from the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair moustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean and elegant person, to feel that the knowledge of form must be congenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so carelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace.'

const high13 = 'As a young admirer had once said of him:  If anybody can tell a fellow just when to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to, its Larry Lefferts.  And on the question of pumps versus patent-leather Oxfords his authority had never been disputed.  My God he said; and silently handed his glass to old Sillerton Jackson.  Newland Archer, following Leffertss glance, saw with surprise that his exclamation had been occasioned by the entry of a new figure into old Mrs. Mingotts box.  It was that of a slim young woman, a little less tall than May Welland, with brown hair growing in close curls about her temples and held in place by a narrow band of diamonds.  The suggestion of this headdress, which gave her what was then called a Josephine look, was carried out in the cut of the dark blue velvet gown rather theatrically caught up under her bosom by a girdle with a large old-fashioned clasp.  The wearer of this unusual dress, who seemed quite unconscious of the attention it was attracting, stood a moment in the centre of the box, discussing with Mrs. Welland the propriety of taking the latters place in the front right-hand corner; then she yielded with a slight smile, and seated herself in line with Mrs. Wellands sister-in-law, Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who was installed in the opposite corner.  Mr. Sillerton Jackson had returned the opera-glass to Lawrence Lefferts.  The whole of the club turned instinctively, waiting to hear what the old man had to say; for old Mr. Jackson was as great an authority on family as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.  He knew all the ramifications of New Yorks cousinships; and could not only elucidate such complicated questions as that of the connection between the Mingotts (through the Thorleys) with the Dallases of South Carolina, and that of the relationship of the elder branch of Philadelphia Thorleys to the Albany Chiverses (on no account to be confused with the Manson Chiverses of University Place), but could also enumerate the leading characteristics of each family: as, for instance, the fabulous stinginess of the younger lines of Leffertses (the Long Island ones); or the fatal tendency of the Rushworths to make foolish matches; or the insanity recurring in every second generation of the Albany Chiverses, with whom their New York cousins had always refused to intermarry--with the disastrous exception of poor Medora Manson, who, as everybody knew ... but then her mother was a Rushworth.  In addition to this forest of family trees, Mr. Sillerton Jackson carried between his narrow hollow temples, and under his soft thatch of silver hair, a register of most of the scandals and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface of New York society within the last fifty years.  So far indeed did his information extend, and so acutely retentive was his memory, that he was supposed to be the only man who could have told you who Julius Beaufort, the banker, really was, and what had become of handsome Bob Spicer, old Mrs. Manson Mingotts father, who had disappeared so mysteriously (with a large sum of trust money) less than a year after his marriage, on the very day that a beautiful Spanish dancer who had been delighting thronged audiences in the old Opera-house on the Battery had taken ship for Cuba.  But these mysteries, and many others, were closely locked in Mr. Jacksons breast; for not only did his keen sense of honour forbid his repeating anything privately imparted, but he was fully aware that his reputation for discretion increased his opportunities of finding out what he wanted to know.  The club box, therefore, waited in visible suspense while Mr. Sillerton Jackson handed back Lawrence Leffertss opera-glass.  For a moment he silently scrutinised the attentive group out of his filmy blue eyes overhung by old veined lids; then he gave his moustache a thoughtful twist, and said simply:  I didnt think the Mingotts would have tried it on.  II.  Newland Archer, during this brief episode, had been thrown into a strange state of embarrassment.  It was annoying that the box which was thus attracting the undivided attention of masculine New York should be that in which his betrothed was seated between her mother and aunt; and for a moment he could not identify the lady in the Empire dress, nor imagine why her presence created such excitement among the initiated.  Then light dawned on him, and with it came a momentary rush of indignation.  No, indeed; no one would have thought the Mingotts would have tried it on  But they had; they undoubtedly had; for the low-toned comments behind him left no doubt in Archers mind that the young woman was May Wellands cousin, the cousin always referred to in the family as poor Ellen Olenska.  Archer knew that she had suddenly arrived from Europe a day or two previously; he had even heard from Miss Welland (not disapprovingly) that she had been to see poor Ellen, who was staying with old Mrs. Mingott.  Archer entirely approved of family solidarity, and one of the qualities he most admired in the Mingotts was their resolute championship of the few black sheep that their blameless stock had produced.'

const high14 = 'There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young mans heart, and he was glad that his future wife should not be restrained by false prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but to receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer, was to be announced within a few weeks.  No, he felt as old Sillerton Jackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on  He knew, of course, that whatever man dared (within Fifth Avenues limits) that old Mrs. Manson Mingott, the Matriarch of the line, would dare.  He had always admired the high and mighty old lady, who, in spite of having been only Catherine Spicer of Staten Island, with a father mysteriously discredited, and neither money nor position enough to make people forget it, had allied herself with the head of the wealthy Mingott line, married two of her daughters to foreigners (an Italian marquis and an English banker), and put the crowning touch to her audacities by building a large house of pale cream-coloured stone (when brown sandstone seemed as much the only wear as a frock-coat in the afternoon) in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.  Old Mrs. Mingotts foreign daughters had become a legend.  They never came back to see their mother, and the latter being, like many persons of active mind and dominating will, sedentary and corpulent in her habit, had philosophically remained at home.  But the cream-coloured house (supposed to be modelled on the private hotels of the Parisian aristocracy) was there as a visible proof of her moral courage; and she throned in it, among pre-Revolutionary furniture and souvenirs of the Tuileries of Louis Napoleon (where she had shone in her middle age), as placidly as if there were nothing peculiar in living above Thirty-fourth Street, or in having French windows that opened like doors instead of sashes that pushed up.  Every one (including Mr. Sillerton Jackson) was agreed that old Catherine had never had beauty--a gift which, in the eyes of New York, justified every success, and excused a certain number of failings. Unkind people said that, like her Imperial namesake, she had won her way to success by strength of will and hardness of heart, and a kind of haughty effrontery that was somehow justified by the extreme decency and dignity of her private life.  Mr. Manson Mingott had died when she was only twenty-eight, and had tied up the money with an additional caution born of the general distrust of the Spicers; but his bold young widow went her way fearlessly, mingled freely in foreign society, married her daughters in heaven knew what corrupt and fashionable circles, hobnobbed with Dukes and Ambassadors, associated familiarly with Papists, entertained Opera singers, and was the intimate friend of Mme. Taglioni; and all the while (as Sillerton Jackson was the first to proclaim) there had never been a breath on her reputation; the only respect, he always added, in which she differed from the earlier Catherine.  Mrs. Manson Mingott had long since succeeded in untying her husbands fortune, and had lived in affluence for half a century; but memories of her early straits had made her excessively thrifty, and though, when she bought a dress or a piece of furniture, she took care that it should be of the best, she could not bring herself to spend much on the transient pleasures of the table.  Therefore, for totally different reasons, her food was as poor as Mrs. Archers, and her wines did nothing to redeem it.  Her relatives considered that the penury of her table discredited the Mingott name, which had always been associated with good living; but people continued to come to her in spite of the made dishes and flat champagne, and in reply to the remonstrances of her son Lovell (who tried to retrieve the family credit by having the best chef in New York) she used to say laughingly:  Whats the use of two good cooks in one family, now that Ive married the girls and cant eat sauces?  Newland Archer, as he mused on these things, had once more turned his eyes toward the Mingott box.  He saw that Mrs. Welland and her sister-in-law were facing their semicircle of critics with the Mingottian APLOMB which old Catherine had inculcated in all her tribe, and that only May Welland betrayed, by a heightened colour (perhaps due to the knowledge that he was watching her) a sense of the gravity of the situation.  As for the cause of the commotion, she sat gracefully in her corner of the box, her eyes fixed on the stage, and revealing, as she leaned forward, a little more shoulder and bosom than New York was accustomed to seeing, at least in ladies who had reasons for wishing to pass unnoticed.  Few things seemed to Newland Archer more awful than an offence against Taste, that far-off divinity of whom Form was the mere visible representative and vicegerent.  Madame Olenskas pale and serious face appealed to his fancy as suited to the occasion and to her unhappy situation; but the way her dress (which had no tucker) sloped away from her thin shoulders shocked and troubled him.  He hated to think of May Wellands being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless of the dictates of Taste.  After all, he heard one of the younger men begin behind him (everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-Martha scenes), after all, just WHAT happened?  Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that.  Hes an awful brute, isnt he? continued the young enquirer, a candid Thorley, who was evidently preparing to enter the lists as the ladys champion.  The very worst; I knew him at Nice, said Lawrence Lefferts with authority.  A half-paralysed white sneering fellow--rather handsome head, but eyes with a lot of lashes.  Well, Ill tell you the sort: when he wasnt with women he was collecting china.  Paying any price for both, I understand.  There was a general laugh, and the young champion said:  Well, then----?  Well, then; she bolted with his secretary.  Oh, I see.  The champions face fell.  It didnt last long, though: I heard of her a few months later living alone in Venice.  I believe Lovell Mingott went out to get her.  He said she was desperately unhappy.  Thats all right--but this parading her at the Operas another thing.  Perhaps, young Thorley hazarded, shes too unhappy to be left at home.  This was greeted with an irreverent laugh, and the youth blushed deeply, and tried to look as if he had meant to insinuate what knowing people called a double entendre.  Well--its queer to have brought Miss Welland, anyhow, some one said in a low tone, with a side-glance at Archer.  Oh, thats part of the campaign: Grannys orders, no doubt, Lefferts laughed.  When the old lady does a thing she does it thoroughly.  The act was ending, and there was a general stir in the box.  Suddenly Newland Archer felt himself impelled to decisive action.  The desire to be the first man to enter Mrs. Mingotts box, to proclaim to the waiting world his engagement to May Welland, and to see her through whatever difficulties her cousins anomalous situation might involve her in; this impulse had abruptly overruled all scruples and hesitations, and sent him hurrying through the red corridors to the farther side of the house.  As he entered the box his eyes met Miss Wellands, and he saw that she had instantly understood his motive, though the family dignity which both considered so high a virtue would not permit her to tell him so. The persons of their world lived in an atmosphere of faint implications and pale delicacies, and the fact that he and she understood each other without a word seemed to the young man to bring them nearer than any explanation would have done.  Her eyes said:  You see why Mamma brought me, and his answered:  I would not for the world have had you stay away.  You know my niece Countess Olenska? Mrs. Welland enquired as she shook hands with her future son-in-law.  Archer bowed without extending his hand, as was the custom on being introduced to a lady; and Ellen Olenska bent her head slightly, keeping her own pale-gloved hands clasped on her huge fan of eagle feathers.  Having greeted Mrs. Lovell Mingott, a large blonde lady in creaking satin, he sat down beside his betrothed, and said in a low tone:  I hope youve told Madame Olenska that were engaged?  I want everybody to know--I want you to let me announce it this evening at the ball.  Miss Wellands face grew rosy as the dawn, and she looked at him with radiant eyes.  If you can persuade Mamma, she said; but why should we change what is already settled?  He made no answer but that which his eyes returned, and she added, still more confidently smiling: Tell my cousin yourself: I give you leave.  She says she used to play with you when you were children.  She made way for him by pushing back her chair, and promptly, and a little ostentatiously, with the desire that the whole house should see what he was doing, Archer seated himself at the Countess Olenskas side.  We DID use to play together, didnt we? she asked, turning her'

Ah, how this brings it all back to me--I see everybody here in knickerbockers and pantalettes, she said, with her trailing slightly foreign accent, her eyes returning to his face.  Agreeable as their expression was, the young man was shocked that they should reflect so unseemly a picture of the august tribunal before which, at that very moment, her case was being tried.  Nothing could be in worse taste than misplaced flippancy; and he answered somewhat stiffly:  Yes, you have been away a very long time.  Oh, centuries and centuries; so long, she said, that Im sure Im dead and buried, and this dear old place is heaven; which, for reasons he could not define, struck Newland Archer as an even more disrespectful way of describing New York societWhenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had. He didnt say any more, but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, Im inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.

Most of the confidences were unsought frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile  levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I dont care what its founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he The Great Gatsby 1 were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperament.it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short−winded elations of men. My family have been prominent, well−to−do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that were descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother, who came here in fifty−one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to−day. I never saw this great−uncle, but Im supposed to look like him with special reference to the rather hard−boiled painting that hangs in fathers office I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter−raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, Whyye−es, with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty−two. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather−beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog at least I had him for a few days until he ran away nd an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. How do you get to West Egg village? he asked helplessly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath−giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and'

const high16 = 'credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News.and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well−rounded man. This isnt just an epigram life is much more successfully looked at The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 2 from a single window, after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. they are not perfect ovals like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was Gatsbys mansion. Or, rather, as I didnt know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbors lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month. Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and Id known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty−one that everything afterward savors of anti−climax. His family were enormously wealthy even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach but now hed left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, hed brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that. Why they came East I dont know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didnt believe it − I had no sight into Daisys heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game. And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red−and−white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun−dials and brick walks and burning gardens finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch. He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw−haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 3 Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage a cruel body. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. Now, dont think my opinion on these matters is final, he seemed to say, just because Im stronger and more of a man than you are. We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. Ive got a nice place here, he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub−nosed motor−boat that bumped the tide offshore. It belonged to Demaine, the oil man. He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. Well go inside. We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy−colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding−cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine−colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then'

const high17 = 'she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 4 Im p−paralyzed with happiness. She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (Ive heard it said that Daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) At any rate, Miss Bakers lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self−sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered Listen, a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. Do they miss me? she cried ecstatically. The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore. How gorgeous Lets go back, Tom. To−morrow Then she added irrelevantly: You ought to see the baby. Id like to. Shes asleep. Shes three years old. Havent you ever seen her? Never. Well, you ought to see her. Shes−. Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. What you doing, Nick? Im a bond man. Who with? I told him. Never heard of them, he remarked decisively. This annoyed me. You will, I answered shortly. You will if you stay in the East. Oh, Ill stay in the East, dont you worry, he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. Id be a God damned fool to live anywhere else. At this point Miss Baker said: Absolutely with such suddenness that I startedit was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 5 Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room. Im stiff, she complained, Ive been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember. Dont look at me, Daisy retorted, Ive been trying to get you to New York all afternoon. No, thanks, said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, Im absolutely in training. Her host looked at her incredulously. You are He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. How you ever get anything done is beyond me. I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she got done. I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small−breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her gray sun−strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before. You live in West Egg, she remarked contemptuously. I know somebody there. I dont know a single−. You must know Gatsby. Gatsby? demanded Daisy. What Gatsby? Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy−colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind. Why candles? objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. In two weeks itll be the longest day in the year. She looked at us all radiantly. Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it. We ought to plan something, yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. All right, said Daisy. Whatll we plan? She turned to me helplessly: What do people plan? Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger. The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 6 Look she complained; I hurt it. We all looked the knuckle was black and blue. You did it, Tom, she said accusingly. I know you didnt mean to, but you did do it. Thats what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a−. I hate that word hulking, objected Tom crossly, even in kidding. Hulking, insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy, I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. Cant you talk about crops or something? I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way. Civilizations going to pieces, broke out Tom violently. Ive gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Colored Empires by this man Goddard? Why, no, I answered, rather surprised by his tone. Well, its a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we dont look out the white race will be will be utterly submerged. Its all scientific stuff; its been proved. Toms getting very profound, said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we − −. Well, these books are all scientific, insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. This fellow has worked out the whole thing. Its up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things. Weve got to beat them down, whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun. You ought to live in California. began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. This idea is that were Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and. After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. And weve produced all the things that go to make civilization − oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see? There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 7 porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. Ill tell you a family secret, she whispered enthusiastically. Its about the butlers nose. Do you want to hear about the butlers nose? Thats why I came over to−night. Well, he wasnt always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose. Things went from bad to worse, suggested Miss Baker. Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position. For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listenedthen the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Toms ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of aof a rose, an absolute rose. Doesnt he? She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: An absolute rose? This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said Sh in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor−. I said. Dont talk. I want to hear what happens. Is something happening? I inquired innocently. You mean to say you dont know? said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. I thought everybody knew. I dont. Why−. she said hesitantly, Toms got some woman in New York. Got some woman? I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 8 She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Dont you think? Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table. It couldnt be helped cried'

const high18 = 'Daisy with tense gayety. She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: I looked outdoors for a minute, and its very romantic outdoors. Theres a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. Hes singing away−. Her voice sang: Its romantic, isnt it, Tom? Very romantic, he said, and then miserably to me: If its light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables. The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldnt guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee. Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. We dont know each other very well, Nick, she said suddenly. Even if we are cousins. You didnt come to my wedding. I wasnt back from the war. Thats true. She hesitated. Well, Ive had a very bad time, Nick, and Im pretty cynical about everything. Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didnt say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. I suppose she talks, and eats, and everything. Oh, yes. She looked at me absently. Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear? Very much. Itll show you how Ive gotten to feel about things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. all right, I said, Im glad its a girl. And I hope shell be a fool thats the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. You see I think everythings terrible The Great Gatsby The Great Gatsby 9 anyhow, she went on in a convinced way. Everybody thinks so the most advanced people. And I know. Ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything. Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Toms, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. Sophisticated God, Im sophisticated The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post.the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp−light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn−leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. To be continued, she said, tossing the magazine on the table, in our very next issue. Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. Ten oclock, she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. Time for this good girl to go to bed. Jordans going to play in the tournament to−morrow, explained Daisy, over at Westchester. Oh youre *Jordan Baker. I knew now why her face was familiar its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. Good night, she said softly. Wake me at eight, wont you. If youll get up. I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon. Of course you will, confirmed Daisy. In fact I think Ill arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and Ill sort of oh fling you together. You knowl ock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing−. Good night, called Miss Baker from the stairs. uck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends of the rope were placed in the strangers hands, he growled menacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car.  The next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but Buck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.  Yep, has fits, the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. Im takin m up for the boss to Frisco.'

const high19 = 'A crack dog-doctor there thinks that he can cure m.  Concerning that nights ride, the man spoke most eloquently for himself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front.  All I get is fifty for it, he grumbled; an I wouldnt do it over for a thousand, cold cash.  His hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle.  How much did the other mug get? the saloon-keeper demanded.  A hundred, was the reply. Wouldnt take a sou less, so help me.  That makes a hundred and fifty, the saloon-keeper calculated; and hes worth it, or Im a squarehead.  The kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand. If I dont get the hydrophoby--  Itll be because you was born to hang, laughed the saloon-keeper. Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight, he added.  Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life half throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But he was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed, and he was flung into a cagelike crate.  There he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath and wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did they want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see the Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Bucks throat was twisted into a savage growl.  But the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels, upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.  For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at him and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs, mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger waxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch. For that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue.  He was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them. They would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was resolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed was he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.  Four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small, high-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver. That was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled himself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.  You aint going to take him out now? the driver asked.  Sure, the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.  There was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance.  Buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.  Now, you red-eyed devil, he said, when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Bucks body. At the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.  And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.  After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.  For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.  Hes no slouch at dog-breakin, thats wot I say, one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.  Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays, was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.  Bucks senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.  Answers to the name of Buck, the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. Well, Buck, my boy, he went on in a genial voice, weve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. Youve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and Ill whale the stuffin outa you. Understand?  As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the mans hand.  He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last'

const high20 =  'Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.  Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.  Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.  Sacredam he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. Dat one dam bully dog Eh? How moch?  Three hundred, and a present at that, was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater. And seem its government money, you aint got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?  Perrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its despatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at Buck he knew that he was one in a thousand--One in ten tousand, he commented mentally.  Buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a good-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened man. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.  In the tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two other dogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a Geological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous sort of way, smiling into ones face the while he meditated some underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Bucks food at the first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of Francoiss whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of Francois, he decided, and the half-breed began his rise in Bucks estimation.  The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. Dave  he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took interest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went to sleep again.  Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Bucks feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow. And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monsters (whales) mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in great security, and there sleeps. —MONTAIGNE. —_Apology for Raimond Sebond_.

The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles....  Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which, cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four miles. —_Scoresby_.  Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes. —_Thomas Beales History of the Sperm Whale_, 1839.  The Cachalot (Sperm Whale) is not only better armed than the True Whale (Greenland or Right Whale) in possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe. —_Frederick Debell Bennetts Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_, 1840.

These things are reciprocal; the ball rebounds, only to bound forward again; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale, the whalemen seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West Passage. —_From_ _Something_ _unpublished_.

Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and gale In his ocean home will be A giant in might, where might is right, And King of the boundless sea. —_Whale Song_. CHAPTER 1. Loomings.  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peoples hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?  But look here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?  Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.  But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherds head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of water there Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.  Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—dont sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.  No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches ones sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.  What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each others shoulder-blades, and be content happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.  Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky—Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight oclock in the morning, not in his wifes bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.  Yes, yes, how was it now? he thought, going over his dream. Now, how was it? To be sure Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang, _Il mio tesoro_—not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too, he remembered.  Stepan Arkadyevitchs eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile. Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that was delightful, only theres no putting it into words, or even expressing it in ones thoughts awake. And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom. And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wifes room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his brows.  Ah, ah, ah Oo... he muttered, recalling everything that had happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his own fault.  Yes, she wont forgive me, and she cant forgive me. And the most awful thing about it is that its all my fault—all my fault, though Im not to blame. Thats the point of the whole situation, he reflected. Oh, oh, oh he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.  Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.  She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.  Whats this? this? she asked, pointing to the letter.  And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wifes words.  There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology)—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.  This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room. Since then she had refused to see her husband.  Its that idiotic smile thats to blame for it all, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.  But whats to be done? Whats to be done? he said to himself in despair, and found no answer.  Chapter 2 Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself. He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself. All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife. But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact. He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view. It had turned out quite the other way.  Oh, its awful oh dear, oh dear awful Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done. And how well things were going up till now how well we got on She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked. Its true its bad _her_ having been a governess in our house. Thats bad Theres something common, vulgar, in flirting with ones governess. But what a governess (He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) But after all, while she was in the house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is that shes already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so Oh, oh But what, what is to be done?  There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself. To forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life.  Then we shall see, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a telegram. Matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.  Are there any papers from the office? asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.  On the table, replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, Theyve sent from the carriage-jobbers.  Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the looking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another. Stepan Arkadyevitchs eyes asked: Why do you tell me that? dont you know?  Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.  I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing, he said. He had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand.  Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened.  Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow, he said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers.  Thank God said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his master, realized the significance of this arrival—that is, that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife.  Alone, or with her husband? inquired Matvey.  Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his upper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.  Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?  Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.'

const high22 = 'Darya Alexandrovna? Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.  Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do what she tells you.  You want to try it on, Matvey understood, but he only said, Yes sir.  Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.  Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let him do—that is you—do as he likes, he said, laughing only with his eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his head on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face.  Eh, Matvey? he said, shaking his head.  Its all right, sir; she will come round, said Matvey.  Come round?  Yes, sir.  Do you think so? Whos there? asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the rustle of a womans dress at the door.  Its I, said a firm, pleasant, womans voice, and the stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the doorway.  Well, what is it, Matrona? queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to her at the door.  Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost every one in the house (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovnas chief ally) was on his side.  Well, what now? he asked disconsolately.  Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She is suffering so, its sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg her forgiveness, sir. Theres no help for it One must take the consequences...  But she wont see me.  You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.  Come, thatll do, you can go, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly. Well now, do dress me. He turned to Matvey and threw off his dressing-gown decisively.  Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horses collar, and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the well-groomed body of his master.  Chapter 3 When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and papers from the office.  He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wifes property. To sell this forest was absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest—that idea hurt him.  When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his coffee. As he sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.  Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority. And in spite of the fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for him, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the majority changed them—or, more strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.  Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn. And for him, living in a certain society—owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental activity—to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat. If there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life. The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money. The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature. The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this, Stepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first founder of his family—the monkey. And so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitchs, and he liked his newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his brain. He read the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress, etc., etc. He read another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain satisfaction. But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovnas advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household. He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind—the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.  But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew thoughtful.  Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside the door. They were carrying something, and dropped it.  I told you not to sit passengers on the roof, said the little girl in English; there, pick them up  Everythings in confusion, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; there are the children running about by themselves. And going to the door, he called them. They threw down the box, that represented a train, and came in to their father.  The little girl, her fathers favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him, and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers. At last the little girl kissed his face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.  How is mamma? he asked, passing his hand over his daughters smooth, soft little neck. Good morning, he said, smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him. He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his fathers chilly smile.  Mamma? She is up, answered the girl. The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.  The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.  The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.  Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each others yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.  And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.  Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, followed the sea with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the _Golden Hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queens Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, bound on other conquests--and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers; kings ships and the ships of men on Change; captains, admirals, the dark interlopers of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned generals  of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth... The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.  The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a great stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.  And this also, said Marlow suddenly, has been one of the dark places of the earth.  He was the only man of us who still followed the sea. The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny. For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine.  His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow. It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said, very slow--I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago--the other day .... Light came out of this river since--you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine--what dye call em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries--a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been, too--used to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here--the very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina--and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death--death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yes--he did it. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate. Or think of a decent young'

const high23 = 'citizen in a toga--perhaps too much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp, march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery, had closed round him--all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of wild men. Theres no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination of the abomination--you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.  He paused.  Mind, he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower--Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to....  He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each other--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on, waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in a hesitating voice, I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit, that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlows inconclusive experiences.  I dont want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,  he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to hear; yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was sombre enough, too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.  I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldnt even look at me. And I got tired of that game, too.  Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there. The North Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I havent been there yet, and shall not try now. The glamours off. Other places were scattered about the hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and... well, we wont talk about that. But there was one yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that I had a hankering after.  True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all I thought to myself, they cant trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats Why shouldnt I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.  You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because its cheap and not so nasty as it looks, they say.  I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I wouldnt have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said My dear fellow, and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--I tried the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job. Heavens Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul. She wrote: It will be delightful. I am ready to do anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots of influence with, etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.  I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick. It appears the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes, two black hens.'

const high37 = 'Fresleven--that was the fellows name, a Dane--thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didnt surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man--I was told the chiefs son--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about Freslevens remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I couldnt let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had never returned. What became of the hens I dont know either. I should think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope for it.  I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the contract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in finding the Companys offices. It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade.  A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting right and left, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked straight at me--still knitting with downcast eyes--and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a vast amount of red--good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I wasnt going into any of these. I was going into the yellow. Dead in the centre. And the river was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake. Ough A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with my French. _Bon Voyage_.  In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets. Well, I am not going to.  I began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It was just as though I had been let into some conspiracy--I dont know--something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me. Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me, too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there'

Not many of those she looked at ever saw her again--not half, by a long way.  There was yet a visit to the doctor. A simple formality, assured me the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows. Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose--there must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead--came from somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Companys business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once. I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples, he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.  The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the while. Good, good for there, he mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather surprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool. I always ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those going out there, he said. And when they come back, too? I asked. Oh, I never see them, he remarked; and, moreover, the changes take place inside, you know. He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. So you are going out there. Famous. Interesting, too. He gave me a searching glance, and made another note. Ever any madness in your family? he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone. I felt very annoyed. Is that question in the interests of science, too? It would be, he said, without taking notice of my irritation, interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot, but... Are you an alienist? I interrupted. Every doctor should be--a little, answered that original, imperturbably. I have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must help me to prove. This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to others. Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my observation... I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical. If I were, said I, I wouldnt be talking like this with you. What you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous, he said, with a laugh. Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun. _Adieu_. How do you English say, eh? Good-bye. Ah Good-bye. _Adieu_. In the tropics one must before everything keep calm.... He lifted a warning forefinger.... _Du calme, du calme_.  One thing more remained to do--say good-bye to my excellent aunt. I found her triumphant. I had a cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for many days--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a ladys drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the fireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted creature--a piece of good fortune for the'

const high36 = 'Company--a man you dont get hold of every day. Good heavens and I was going to take charge of a two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached It appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital--you know. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort of apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways, till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit.  You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire, she said, brightly. Its queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything like it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.  After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write often, and so on--and I left. In the street--I dont know why--a queer feeling came to me that I was an imposter. Odd thing that I, who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours notice, with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a moment--I wont say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this commonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the centre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the earth.  I left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, Come and find out. This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam. Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various places--trading places--with names like Gran Bassam, Little Popo; names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister back-cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the uniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks--these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasnt even a shed there, and she was'

const high25 = 'shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech--and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives--he called them enemies--hidden out of sight somewhere.In the end, write it down. Back up and find the story. Mr. Simet, my English and journalism teacher, says the best way to write a story, be it fact or fiction, is to believe aliens will find it someday and make a movie, and you dont want them making Ishtar. The trick is to dig out the people and events that connect, and connect them. No need to worry about whos wearing Nike and whos wearing Reebok, or anybodys hat size or percentage of body fat. Like Jack Webb on the Dragnet series on Nick at Nite says, Just the facts, maam. Just the facts. The facts. Im black. And Japanese. And white. Politically correct would be African-American, Japanese-American and what? Northern European-American? God, by the time I wrote all that on a job application the position would be filled. Besides, Ive never been to Africa, never been to Japan, and dont even know which countries make up Northern Europe. Plus, I know next to nothing about the individuals who contributed all that exotic DNA, so its hard to carve out a cultural identity in my mind. So: Mixed. Blended. Pureed. Potpourri. Adopted. Big deal; so was Superman. And like Superman, I was adopted by great people. The woman I call Mom-who is Mom-Abby Jones, was in the hospital following her fourth miscarriage (and final attempt at the miracle of birth) where she met my biological mother, Glenda, right after my presumed bio-dad, Stephan, had assisted in my natural childbirth only to come eyeball-to-eyeball with the aforementioned UNICEF poster boy. A second-generation German-American married to a woman of Swiss-Norwegian descent, he was a goner before my toes cleared the wet stuff. Any way he matched up the fruit flies, he couldnt come up with me. Because my mom is one of those magic people with the natural capacity to make folks in shitty circumstances feel less shitty, she consoled Glenda and even brought her home until she could get her feet on the ground. Evidently Glenda was as surprised as Stephan; shed had a one-night stand with my sperm donor to get even for a good thumping and had no idea the tall black-Japanese poets squiggly swimmer was the one in a billion to crash through to the promised land. Things sped rapidly downhill for Glenda as a single mother, and two years later, when she brought Child Protection Services crashing down on herself, getting heavily into crack and crank and heavily out of taking care of me, she remembered Moms kindness, tracked her down and begged her to take me. Mom and Dad didnt blink-almost as if they were expecting me, to hear them tell it-and all of a sudden I was the rainbow-coalition kid of two white, upwardly mobile ex-children of the sixties. Actually, only Mom was upwardly mobile. Shes a lawyer, working for the assistant attorney generals office, mostly on child-abuse cases. Dad likes motorcycles; hes just mobile. We never did hear from Glenda again, Mom says probably because the separation was too painful, and shameful. Sometimes I find myself longing for her, just to see or talk with her, discover more about the unsettledness within me; but most of the time that ache sits in a shaded corner of my mind, a vague reminder of what it is not to be wanted. At the same time all that seems out of place, because I remember nothing about her, not what she looked like or the sound of her voice or even the touch of her hand. I do admit to having a few laughs imagining how history rewrote itself inside Stephans head when my shiny brown head popped out. Its interesting being of color in a part of the country where Mark Fuhrman has his own radio talk show. My parents have always encouraged me to be loud when I run into racism, but I cant count on racism being loud when it runs into me. Very few people come out and say they dont like you because you arent white; when youre younger it comes at a birthday party you learn about after the fact, or later, having a girl say yes to a date only to come back after discussing it with her parents, having suddenly remembered she has another engagement that night. Not much to do about that but let it register and dont forget it. I learned in grade school that the color of a persons skin has to do only with where their way-long-ago ancestors originated, so my mind tells me all racists are either ignorant or so down on themselves they need somebody to be better than. Most of the time telling myself that works. Once in a while my gut pulls rank on my mind, and Im compelled to get ugly. I called All News All Talk Radio a couple of days after the first time I heard the spectacularly racially sensitive ex-L.A. detective giving Spokane and the rest of the Inland Empire the hot poop on big-time crime fighting. The talk show I called had featured the mayors of an eastern Washington and a north Idaho town declaring that the racist label put on this region is undeserved, blown out of proportion due to the presence of the Aryan Nations fort over in Hayden Lake, Idaho, and the existence of several small militias spread out between central Washington and eastern Montana. The mayors had departed when the talk-jock finally said, Were talking with T. J. from Cutter, about fifty miles outside our great city. I said, So this racist label, its undeserved? I believe it is, he said. An entire region cant be held responsible for the ignorant actions of a few. Certainly you cant argue with that. Youre right, I said. I cant. But if the racist label is about perceptions, and in this case, undeserved perceptions, why would you guys have the Mark Fuhrman show? Have you tuned in to Marks show? Not purposely, I said, but I was scanning the stations and landed right on him. How long did you listen? Long enough to convince myself it was really him, that you guys werent just pulling my chain. Then you heard a man who knows a lot about crime prevention and an accomplished professional radio man. I said, His voice was okay. The jock said, Whats your point, T. J.? That if you guys are running the most powerful AM station in the region and youre worried about peoples perceptions of that region as racist, you might think twice before you give one of the true icons of racism in this country two hours of drive-time radio every week. We didnt hire Mark to talk about race relations. We hired him to talk about criminals and the criminal mind, and about the intricacies of police work. Hes written books on the subject, you know. You didnt hire him because of his famous name? No, sir, we did not. So when you decided your listeners needed to learn about Spokane, Washington, police work, you figured youd get better expertise from a dishonored ex-L.A. cop rather than some retired veteran Spokane cop who might have covered Spokane s streets for twenty-five or thirty years? He said, How old are you? What does that matter? You sound like a kid. You tell me why that matters, and Ill tell you how old I am. It matters because if youre too young, you might lack the experience to carry on this conversation intelligently. Im a fifty-six-year-old retired Spokane policeman, I said, and paused a moment. Guess I dont have the voice for it. I hung up. Im really not bothered by the race thing most of the time; at least I can say I dont bring it up first. And Ive never wanted to be anyone else, and I dont want to be any other color. My bio-daddy must have had a pretty good brain because I have a big-time I.Q. and, Simet says, monster talent in articulation, plus Im almost six-two and just a little under two hundred pounds. I can stuff a basketball from a standstill, and Ive'

When I was thirteen, I qualified for the Junior Olympics in two swimming events, and Im even a pretty fair cowboy, having spent parts of three summers at Little Britches Rodeo Camp. Thats a pretty fair resume for a guy who, until this year, never participated in one second of organized high school sports. And Im not hard to look at. Mr. Simet says I look like Tiger Woods on steroids, so I get plenty of chances to socialize. For every girl whose parents are terrified of a muddied gene pool, theres a girl who would use me as a threat to do just that. And there are plenty of girls who dont care one way or the other. The truly unique thing about me isnt my racial heritage, or my brain or my size or my athletic abilities. Momma Glenda didnt leave me with much to remember her by, but she certainly left me with the all-time moniker. A lot of kids whose parents grew up in the hippie generation have names like Autumn or Somber or Twilight or Destiny. Who knows what their parents were smoking to name them after seasons or moods or times of day, but good old Glenda went them one better, naming me in her spiritual period. She may have been a little too spiritual on mood-altering funstuff to imagine my first day in kindergarten. Tell everyone your first name when your turn comes, Mrs. Herrick said, nodding to the pencil-necked, tow-headed kid next to me. The kid said, Roger. I said, The. Excuse me? The. She should have said, Tell everyone what people call you. The other kids giggled. My fists clenched, blood rushing into my head. Mrs. Herrick said, Uh, do you have a middle name? Tao, I said, pronouncing it correctly as Dow. Your name is The Tao? What kind of name is that? I shrugged. Mine. To her credit, Mrs. Herrick glanced at her class roster to see if I was telling the truth and moved on, but as you might guess, that wasnt the end of it. Its a book, I told Sue Eldridge and Ronnie Blackburn later, my back against the jackets hanging on hooks at the rear of the room. I was as yet unaware it is also an entire philosophy. Why did your mother give you the same name as a book? Sue asked. Just did. I wanted to explain that my real mother, Abby, didnt do that; that it was my buy-O mother, but I hadnt been real successful articulating that in the past. Ronnie laughed and turned to the rest of the class, who were pulling on their coats for recess. His mom gave him the same name as a book he yelled to them. Then a light clicked above his head. Hey, he said, me, too. My mom gave me the same name as a book, too. Im Curious George He squealed in delight, falling to the floor between giggles, scratching under his arms like an ape. Suddenly he was struggling to push my knee off his chest. Stop Mrs. Herrick yelled, but I punched Ronnie Blackburn in the nose anyway. It was the beginning of a series of unplanned three-day vacations that would dot my educational career like chicken pox. But theres worse news about my handle, and if youve been paying attention, you know what it is: My health dictates the health of the nations economy. Hows your son doing, Mr. Jones The Taos up today, sir. Thats good news. Try to keep him happy. Think I dont get carried away with those? To avoid confusion, and raucous laughter whenever my name is mentioned, Im called T. J. Its over now. Im at the end of the summer following my senior year in high school; I have my diploma in a lockbox and the advantage of hindsight. But I want to tell it without that advantage-tell it as it unfolded-Mr. Simet says any story is only true in the moment. My father always said there are no coincidences; that when two seemingly related events occur, they are related and should be treated that way. My father had very good reasons to try to understand how the universe works, which Im sure Ill get into later. The seemingly related things that I believe kick this story off happen on the second day of school. Coaches have tried to get me to turn out for sports since junior high. Sometimes theyre insistent and sometimes downright nasty, accusing me of lacking the high school equivalent of patriotism, even to the point of calling me a traitor. But Ive always eluded them. Ill play basketball three or four hours nonstop on open gym night, and Ive always taken a couple of guys to Hoopfest in Spokane, which is the largest three-on-three street-basketball tournament in the country, and my team has won its division every time. I think I could have been a pretty fair football player; Im sure not afraid to take a hit or to put a good lick on a guy, but something inside me recoils at being told what to do, and that doesnt sit well with most coaches, who are paid to do exactly that. I dont blame them; I know its me. But the better you know yourself, the better chance you have of staying clear of trouble, and Im pretty sure Id never have lasted a full season of football with Coach Benson or basketball with Coach Roundtree. At one point or another in the heat of a game, Benson and Roundtree retreat to the time-tested and highly grating tool of public humiliation as a motivator, and that particular tool brings me back in your face faster than a yo-yo on a bungee cord, at which time I immediately suspend the notion of giving a shit. So why was I considering joining a swim team that didnt exist before this year when I havent been competitive in the water since fourteen, except for trying to beat Dad into the shower every morning? Its Simet. He catches me after third-period English and says, Jones, didnt you used to be a pretty good swimmer? Im still a pretty good swimmer, I say. Wanna try me? Simet and I enjoy a longstanding rivalry wherein one of us challenges the other to some athletic contest. We handicap it based on our abilities (he lies like a student with a term paper due to get an advantage) and then make a friendly wager, say my English grade against some unsavory task he needs done, like stirring his compost heap when the temperature rises above eighty, or washing and waxing his Humvee, which looks better dirty. He says, I want to try you, but not against me. Who? Someone different every week. Visions of age-group swimming pop up: permanently chlorinated hair and eyes, clogged sinuses, ear infections. This has a familiar ring. What do you think? That you generally give me less information than I need to make an informed decision. He gathers his books and nods toward the parking lot. Hop into my babe-mobile and Ill buy you a milk shake. Maybe a pizza. Well talk. I follow him down the hall. Make it a steak. Something is sick and wrong here. Lets hope it takes you a while to figure out what it is. At Solomons Pizza, Simet tells me that Mr. Morgan, the principal, asked him to replace Mr. Packenbush as assistant wrestling coach, whos resigning due to reasons of health. In a burst of panic, Simet told Morgan hes been trying to get a swimming team going, since Cutter is one of only three high schools in the conference without one. I say, Morgan, of course, pointed out that we dont have a pool. Way ahead of him, he says back. I told him I could get free workout time at All Night Fitness, which Im praying will actually be true. The pool at All Night is twenty yards, I remind him, with an underwater ledge at the shallow end that will give you a subdural hematoma if you flip your turn. A subdural hematoma is what happens to your brain if you get whacked on the head hard enough to bounce it off the inside of your skull. I hear that term a lot when my mom is trying a child-abuse case. Simet says Im mucking things up with details- With only four lanes- – making it more difficult than it had to be. -and a ladder smack in the middle of one of them. I should think of it as a challenge. Every meet would be away, I tell him. No teams would come here to swim. In a twenty-yard pool, records dont count. All part of what makes an insurmountable obstacle interesting, he says. A perennial road team. Mermen without a pond. Youre forgetting something else. Nobody I swam with in age-group swimming lives here. There cant be three real swimmers in this entire school. He considers that a minute, takes a bite of pizza and a long swallow on his beer. Im going off the record here, he says. Educators are supposed to stick together and not bad-mouth one another, so we can collectively stay ahead of the educatees. But do you know Coach Murphy? Murphy is sixty-eight years old, having received divine dispensation to teach till two days after he dies, and I have judiciously avoided taking PE or health classes from him for four years. He tolerates zero bullshit or less. Yeah, I know Coach Murphy. Then you know what my life would be like as his assistant. He leans forward. I have my ways, Jones. If I go down, you go with me, which is to say if I coach wrestling, you wrestle. You have completed six semesters of English. You need eight. Think how easy it would be for me to misplace your records a week before graduation or remove a leg from one of your As. Youd be caught at Cutter High School like a rat in a Twilight Zone cage. Theyre really willing to let you have this team? No facility, no swimmers? One swimmer, he says. One used-to-be swimmer, I say back. T. J., Ive looked at some of your old times. You were phenomenal. And Ive coached some big-time swimmers, guys headed for the trials. Tell you what, I can whip you into good-enough shape to get us points at State, which would elevate Cutter in the overall all-sport state championship. Spock, are you out of your Vulcan mind? I ask in my best William Shatner, which isnt all that bad. Simet fixes his gaze on the table. Actually, thats why they agreed. I told them you were a lock. If I dont come through, theyll sue for malpractice. You mean if I dont come through, theyll sue for malpractice. Same thing. If its the same thing, you swim. He nods at the remaining slice of pizza and says, Go ahead and eat that, which means he is desperate. He glances at his watch as I snap it up. You dont have to answer tonight. Ill give you twelve hours. It could be worse. Simet is a guy who always teaches you something, and its not always about English or journalism. He was a hell of a swimmer himself in his younger years, when dinosaurs roamed the planet, and he seldom lets his classes forget what a spiritual experience it is to test yourself against that particular element. And though I burned out on it back then, I remember what amazing solace I felt working out. Up until I started swimming in grade school, half my teachers wanted me medicated and the other half wanted me in reform school. It helped me focus, beveled the edges on my boundless, uncontrolled energy, dulled my rage. All things considered, it is enough to make me consider Simets proposal. And here comes the kicker, the thing my father would say couldnt be a coincidence. Im walking out of Simets room the next day, thinking if I go along with him, Ill be breaking a career-long rule banning myself from organized sports while playing as many disorganized sports as time in my life allows. I mean, I love athletics. When Im gliding to the hoop in a pickup game, or gunning some guy down at home plate from center field in a summer vacant-lot game, or falling into a perfect pace five miles out on a run, I feel downright godlike. But those things I do on my own. Cutter is such a jock school; they pray before games and cajole you to play out of obligation, and fans scream obscenities at one another from the stands, actually creating rivalries between towns, which has always seemed crazy to me. I remember my freshman year when the entire town was actually happy because the stud running back from Jackson Quarry became ineligible because of grades. Our educational community got giddy because some kid they didnt know tanked his math class. I mean, fifteen seconds after I finish a three-on-three game at Hoopfest, Im sitting on the curb sharing Gatorade with the guys on the other team, talking about moves they put on me, and vice versa. Why would anyone want his opponent not to be at his best? Im on a roll there, but the point is that athletics has become such a big thing here that our administration begins each year figuring ways to pile up points for this all-sport state championship. And the symbol, the Shroud of Turin for Cutter High athletes, is the letter jacket. A block C on a blue-and-gold leather-and-wool jacket at Cutter High School is worth a whole bunch of second chances in the front office, of which Im still waiting for my first. Those who dont own one of those jackets can easily become victims of our zero-tolerance policy. Well, in the eyes of The Tao Jones, nothing is true without its opposite, and it has been my minor quest to make sure that the finest athlete at Cutter High School did his very best to never earn that jacket. I should also say Im not totally righteous in my quest for athletic purity. When I was an age-group swimmer I was driven. It consumed me, and I get uneasy thinking of becoming that focused on it again. Variation on the theme. Im moving catlike through the halls toward my locker minutes after Simet has challenged me to become the Mark Spitz of the desert (we dont have a swimming pool) and run into Mike Barbour-linebacker extraordinaire and student most likely to graduate with multiple felonies-jacking up Chris Coughlin against the lockers by the drinking fountain because Chris is wearing his dead brothers letter jacket. Chris Coughlin is big-time special ed. Hes mainstreamed into PE and industrial arts, but spends most of his time in Resource Room improving his reading skills enough to read traffic signs and memorizing the intricacies of basic addition and subtraction. Everyone knows Chriss story: born addicted to crack cocaine, then got a double dose of shit just after his first birthday when his mothers boyfriend wrapped his face in Saran Wrap to make him stop crying. At his sentencing the boyfriend said he only wanted to make Chris pass out, not cause permanent brain damage. Oops. Anyway, Chriss aunt and uncle took him and did all they could to make it up to him, but they couldnt regenerate brain cells. Chriss older half-brother, Brian, was raised by his own biological father and is something of a legend around Cutter from four or five years ago for having gained more yards in football and for hitting more home runs in baseball than any Cutter Wolverine before or since, and for being drafted into the Cincinnati Reds farm system out of high school. He was destined to have a street or a small park named after him someday, but was killed in a freak rock-climbing accident in the spring of his senior year. That about did poor old Chris in. He didnt have much, but he had a famous big brother. Brian was a real class act: good student, good athlete, great guy. The only times I remember seeing Chris smile were when he rode behind Brian on his dirt bike, or later, after Brian was gone, when hed brag to anyone who would listen every time he passed Brians picture in the trophy case. They didnt live together, but Brian sure let everyone know Chris was his brother, and if you messed with Chris back in those days-he was an easy mark-you could expect a visit from Brian. So Barbour has the jacket buttoned at the bottom and pulled down around Chriss shoulders so he cant move his arms, and his nose is about an inch from Chriss. I cant hear what hes saying, but tears squirt out of Chriss terrified eyes and his entire body trembles. I hustle over and insert myself between them, put an arm over Chriss shoulder, and say, Whats the matter, buddy? You look like youve been staring into a giant asshole, and move him a few steps down the hall, adjusting the jacket. Chris is hyperventilating, barely able to breathe. When you see one of those, I tell him, loud enough for Barbour to hear, you gotta close your eyes and pretend its not there. Course it helps if you also hold your breath. Barbours hand clamps onto my shoulder, and I turn in mock surprise. Barbour Sup, man? I was talking to him, shithead. Thats Mister Shithead to you. You were talking to my buddy Chris? He has to get to class. I run his complaint department, though, right, Chris? Still speechless, Chris nods. Barbour says, Fine. Ill tell you. Next time I see him in this jacket, Ill take it off him and burn it. You earn one of these if youre gonna wear it at this school, something youre too chickenshit to know anything about. Its an honor to wear these colors. You dont put on the jacket your brother earned. Thats an athletic department rule. I say, Doesnt apply. Chris isnt in the athletic department, and Barbour says, Yeah, well, in this school an athletic department rule is a school rule. Guess that wasnt in my orientation packet, I say. Whats the matter with you, Barbour? You know the deal with Coughlins brother. Is this prick thing habitual, or do you work at it? One of these days youre going to find out, Jones. I lie awake nights, waiting for that day. Barbour says, Ill save my energy for a white man. Because of your limited I.Q. Ill give you one of those, my friend. One more will get us both a three-day suspension. Barbours family is famous for their send-all-the-Japs-back-to-Japan-with-a-nigger-under-each-arm attitude, so I feel like I have to hold my own. We stand facing each other a few seconds, and finally Barbour reiterates the athletic departments zero-tolerance position on letter jackets and walks away. I pat Chriss shoulder and tell him not to worry about it and start for class, but look back to see him stuffing the jacket into his locker, trying in vain to cram it behind his books. I walk back, pull the jacket out, and hand it to him. Chris, you can wear it. Its okay. He said it was a rule. He lied. You can wear it anytime you want. He said the athletic department gots a rule. It belonged to your brother, Chris. You wear it. If'

const high27 = 'Barbour gives you any more trouble, you come tell me, okay? Chris stares at me. Okay? Okay. He says it without conviction. As I turn the corner for class, I glance back again, and Coughlin is frantically stuffing the jacket back into the locker. I stay in the afternoon to catch up on an article for the school paper, and catch a flash of blue and gold as I pass the janitor emptying the days leavings into the Dumpster. I wait until he moves back inside and take a look, and sure enough, drag a Cutter High letter jacket out, with COUGHLIN lettered across the back. Later I drive over to All Night Fitness to see if there is any possibility I can train in that pool. We have a family membership, so I spend time there already, but almost never in the water. Since its the only indoor pool in town, All Night rents it out for parties and YMCA swim lessons and womens and seniors water aerobics classes. I hope to swim a few laps to get a feel, but a sign on the entrance says PRIVATE GROUP. I push the swinging door open and stand just inside. The Madness of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder. Trees restless, temperatures falling, the whole northern religion of things coming to an end. No children in the yards here. Shadows lengthened on yellowing zoysia. Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks rained acorns on houses with no mortgage. Storm windows shuddered in the empty bedrooms. And the drone and hiccup of a clothes dryer, the nasal contention of a leaf blower, the ripening of local apples in a paper bag, the smell of the gasoline with which Alfred Lambert had cleaned the paintbrush from his morning painting of the wicker love seat. Three in the afternoon was a time of danger in these gerontocratic suburbs of St. Jude. Alfred had awakened in the great blue chair in which hed been sleeping since lunch. Hed had his nap and there would be no local news until five oclock. Two empty hours were a sinus in which infections, bred. He struggled to his feet and stood by the Ping-Pong table, listening in vain for Enid. Ringing throughout the house was an alarm bell that no one but Alfred and Enid could hear directly. It was the alarm bell of anxiety. It was like one of those big cast-iron dishes with an electric clapper that send schoolchildren into the street in fire drills. By now it had been ringing for so many hours that the Lamberts no longer heard the message of bell ringing but, as with any sound that continues for so long that you have the leisure to learn its component sounds (as with any word you stare at until it resolves itself into a string of dead letters), instead heard a clapper rapidly striking a metallic resonator, not a pure tone but a granular sequence of percussions with a keening overlay of overtones; ringing for so many days that it simply blended into the background except at certain early-morning hours when one or the other of them awoke in a sweat and realized that a bell had been ringing in their heads for so long as they could remember; ringing for so many months that the sound had given way to a kind of metasound whose rise and fall was not the beating of compression waves but the much, much slower waxing and waning of their consciousness of the sound. Which consciousness was particularly acute when the weather itself was in an anxious mood. Then Enid and Alfred -- she on her knees in the dining room opening drawers, he in the basement surveying the disastrous Ping-Pong table -- each felt near to exploding with anxiety. The anxiety of coupons, in a drawer containing candles in designer autumn colors. The coupons were bundled in a rubber band, and Enid was realizing that their expiration dates (often jauntily circled in red by the manufacturer) lay months and even years in the past: that these hundred-odd coupons, whose total face value exceeded sixty dollars (potentially one hundred twenty dollars at the Chiltsville supermarket that doubled coupons), had all gone bad. Tilex, sixty cents off. Excedrin PM, a dollar off. The dates were not even close. The dates were historical. The alarm bell had been ringing for years. She pushed the coupons back in among the candles and shut the drawer. She was looking for a letter that had come by Registered mail some days ago. Alfred had heard the mailman knock on the door and had shouted, Enid Enid so loudly that he couldnt hear her shouting back, Al, Im getting it Hed continued to shout her name, coming closer and closer, and because the sender of the letter was the Axon Corporation, 24 East Industrial Serpentine, Schwenksville, PA, and because there were aspects of the Axon situation that Enid knew about and hoped that Alfred didnt, shed quickly stashed the letter somewhere within fifteen feet of the front door. Alfred had emerged from the basement bellowing like a piece of earth-moving equipment, Theres somebody at the door and shed fairly screamed, The mailman The mailman and hed shaken his head at the complexity of it all.'

const high35 = 'Garps mother, Jenny Fields, was arrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding a man in a movie theater. This was shortly after the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor and people were being tolerant of soldiers, because suddenly everyone was a soldier, but Jenny Fields was quite firm in her intolerance of the behavior of men in general and soldiers in particular. In the movie theater she had to move three times, but each time the soldier moved closer to her until she was sitting against the musty wall, her view of the newsreel almost blocked by some silly colonnade, and she resolved she would not get up and move again. The soldier moved once more and sat beside her. Jenny was twenty-two. She had dropped out of college almost as soon as shed begun, but she had finished her nursing-school program at the head of her class and she enjoyed being a nurse. She was an athletic-looking young woman who always had high color in her cheeks; she had dark, glossy hair and what her mother called a mannish way of walking (she swung her arms), and her rump and hips were so slender and hard that, from behind, she resembled a young boy. In Jennys opinion, her breasts were too large; she thought the ostentation of her bust made her look cheap and easy. She was nothing of the kind. In fact, she had dropped out of college when she suspected that the chief purpose of her parents sending her to Wellesley had been to have her dated by and eventually mated to some well-bred man. The recommendation of Wellesley had come from her older brothers, who had assured her parents that Wellesley women were not thought of loosely and were considered high in marriage potential. Jenny felt that her education was merely a polite was to bide time, as if she were really a cow, being prepared only for the insertion of the device for artificial insemination. Her declared major had been English literature, but when it seemed to her that her classmates were chiefly concerned with acquiring the sophistication and--poise to deal with men, she had no trouble leaving literature for nursing. She saw nursing as something that could be put into immediate practice, and its study had no ulterior motive that Jenny could see (later she wrote, in her famous autobiography, that too many nurses put themselves on display for too many doctors; but then her nursing days were over). She liked the simple, no-nonsense uniform; the blouse of the dress made less of her breasts; the shoes were comfortable, and suited to her fast pace of walking. When she was at the night desk, she could still read. She did not miss the young college men, who were sulky and disappointed if you wouldnt compromise yourself, and superior and aloof it you would. At the hospital she saw more soldiers and working boys than college men, and they were franker and less pretentious in their expectations; if you compromised yourself a little, they seemed at least grateful to see you again. Then, suddenly, everyone was a soldier--and full of the self-importance of college boys--and Jenny Fields stopped having anything to do with men. My mother, Garp wrote, was a lone wolf. The Fields family fortune was in shoes, though Mrs. Fields, a former Boston Weeks, had brought some money of her own to the marriage. The Fields family had managed well enough with footwear to have removed themselves from the shoe factories years ago. They lived in a large, shingled house on the New Hampshire shore at Dogs Head Harbor. Jenny went home for her days and nights off--mainly to please her mother, and to convince the grande dame that although Jenny was slumming her life away as a nurse, as her mother remarked, she was not developing slovenly habits in her speech or in her moral person. Jenny frequently met her brothers at the North Station and rode home on the train with them. As all members of the Fields family were bidden to do, they rode on the right-hand side of the Boston and Maine when the train left Boston and sat on the left when they returned. This complied with the wishes of the senior Mr. Fields, who admitted that the ugliest scenery lay out that side of the train, but he felt that all Fieldses should be forced to face the grimy source of their independence and higher life. On the right-hand side of the train, leaving Boston, and on the left as you returned, you passed the Fields Factory Outlet in Haverhill, and the vast billboard with the huge work shoe taking a firm step toward you. The billboard towered above the railroad yard and was reflected in countless miniatures in the windows of the shoe plant. Beneath this menacing, advancing foot were the words: FIELDS FOR YOUR FEET IN THE FACTORY OR IN THE FIELDS There was a Fields line of nursing shoe, and Mr. Fields gave his daughter a free pair whenever she came home; Jenny must have had a dozen pairs.'

const high28 = 'Mrs. Fields, who insisted on equating her daughters leaving Wellesley with a sordid future, also gave Jenny a present every time she came home. Mrs. Fields gave her daughter a hot-water bottle, or so she said--and so Jenny assumed; she never opened the packages. Her mother would say, Dear, do you still have that hotwater bottle I gave you? And Jenny would think a minute, believing she had left it on the train or thrown it away, and shed say, I may have lost it, Mother, but Im sure I dont need another one. And Mrs. Fields, bringing the package out from hiding, would press it on her daughter: it was still concealed in the drugstore paper. Mrs. Fields would say, Please, Jennifer, be more careful. And use it, please As a nurse, Jenny saw little use for the hot-water bottle; she assumed it to be a touching, odd device of old-fashioned and largely psychological comfort. But some of the packages made it back to her small room near Boston Mercy Hospital. She kept them in a closet, which was nearly full of boxes of nursing shoes--also unopened. She felt detached from her family, and thought it strange how they had lavished so much attention on her, as a child, and then at some appointed, prearranged time they seemed to stop the flow of affection and begin the expectations--as if, for a brief phase, you were expected to absorb love (and get enough) and then, for a much longer and more serious phase you were expected to fulfill certain obligations. When Jenny had broken the chain, had left Wellesley for something as common as nursing, she had dropped her family--and they, as if they couldnt help themselves, were in the process of dropping her. In the Fields family, for example, it would have been more appropriate if Jenny had become a doctor, or if shed stayed in college until she married one. Each time she saw her brothers, her mother, and her father, they were more uncomfortable in one anothers presence. They were involved in that awkward procedure of getting to unknow each other. That must be how families are, thought Jenny Fields. She felt if she ever had children she would love them no less when they were twenty than when they were two; they might need you more at twenty, she thought. What do you really need when youre two? In the hospital, the babies were the easiest patients. The older they got, the more they needed; and the less anyone wanted or loved them. Jenny felt she had grown up on a large ship without having seen, much less understood, the engine room. She liked how the hospital reduced everything to what one ate, if it helped one to have eaten it, and where it went. As a child she had never seen the dirty dishes; in fact, when the maids cleared the table, Jenny was sure they were throwing the dishes away (it was some time before she was even allowed in the kitchen). And when the milk truck brought the bottles every morning, for a while Jenny thought that the truck brought the days dishes too--the sound, that glassy clatter and bang, being so like the sound of the maids in the closed kitchen, doing whatever they did to the dishes. Jenny Fields was five before she saw her fathers bathroom. She tracked it down one morning by following the scent of her fathers cologne. She found a steamy shower stall--quite modern for 1925--a private toilet, a row of bottles so unlike her mothers bottles that Jenny thought she had discovered the lair of a secret man living undetected in their house for years. In fact, she had. In the hospital, Jenny knew where everything went and she was learning the unmagical answers to where almost everything came from. At Dogs Head Harbor, when Jenny had been a girl, the family members had their own baths, their own rooms, their own doors with their own mirrors on the backs. In the hospital, privacy was not sacred: nothing was a secret; if you wanted a mirror, you had to ask a nurse. The most mysterious thing she had been allowed to investigate on her own, when Jenny was a child, had been the cellar and the great pottery crock which every Monday was filled with clams. Jennys mother sprinkled cornmeal on the clams at night and every morning they were rinsed in fresh sea water from a long pipe that ran into the basement from the sea itself. By the weekend the clams were fat and free of sand, they were growing too big for their shells, and their great, obscene necks lolled on the salt water.'

const high34 = 'Jenny would help the cook sort through them on Fridays; the dead ones did not retract their necks when touched. Jenny asked for a book about clams. She read all about them: how they ate, how they bred, how they grew. It was the first live thing she understood completely--its life, its sex, its death. At Dogs Head Harbor, human beings were not that accessible. In the hospital, Jenny Fields felt she was making up for lost time; she was discovering that people werent much more mysterious, or much more attractive, than clams. My mother, Garp wrote, was not one for making fine distinctions. One striking difference she might have seen between clams and people was that most people had some sense of humor, but Jenny was not inclined toward humor. There was a popular joke among the nurses in Boston at that time, but it was not funny to Jenny Fields. The joke involved the other hospitals in Boston. The hospital Jenny worked in was Boston Mercy Hospital, which was called Boston Mercy; there was also Massachusetts General Hospital, which was called Mass General. And another hospital was the Peter Bent Brigham, which was called the Peter Bent. One day, the joke goes, a Boston cab driver had his taxi hailed by a man who staggered off the curb toward him, almost dropping to his knees in the street. The man was purple in the face with pain; he was either strangling or holding his breath, so that talking was difficult for him, and the cabby opened the door and helped him inside, where the man lay face down on the floor alongside the back seat, tucking his knees up to his chest. Hospital Hospital he cried. The Peter Bent? the cabby asked. That was the closest hospital. Its worse than bent, the man moaned. I think Molly bit it off Few jokes were funny to Jenny Fields, and certainly not this one; no peter jokes for Jenny, who was staying clear of the issue. She had seen the trouble peters could get into; babies were not the worst of it. Of course she saw people who didnt want to have babies, and they were sad that they were pregnant; they shouldnt have to have babies, Jenny thought--though she mainly felt sorry for the babies who were born. She saw people who wanted to have babies, too, and they made her want to have one. One day, Jenny Fields though, she would like to have a baby--just one. But the trouble was that she wanted as little to do with a peter as possible, and nothing whatsoever to do with a man. Most peter treatment Jenny saw was done to soldiers. The U. S. Army would not begin to benefit from the discovery of penicillin until 1943, and there were many soldiers who didnt get penicillin until 1945. At Boston Mercy, in the early days of 1942, peters were usually treated with sulfa and arsenic. Sulfathiazole was for the clap--with lots of water recommended. For syphilis, in the days before penicillin, they used neoarsphenamine; Jenny Fields thought that this was the epitome of all that sex could lead to--to introduce arsenic into the human chemistry, to try to clean the chemistry up. The other peter treatment was local and also required a lot of fluid. Jenny frequently assisted with this method of disinfecting, because the patient required lots of attention at the time; sometimes, in fact, he needed to be held. It was a simple procedure that could force as much as one hundred ccs of fluid up the penis and through the surprised urethra before it all came back, but the procedure left everyone feeling a bit raw. The man who invented a device for this method of treatment was named Valentine, and his device was called the Valentine irrigator. Long after Dr. Valentines irrigator was improved, or replaced with another irrigation device, the nurses at Boston Mercy still referred to the procedure as the Valentine treatment--an appropriate punishment for a lover, thought Jenny Fields. My mother, Garp wrote, was not romantically inclined. When the soldier in the movie theater first started changing seats--when he made his first move on her--Jenny Fields felt that the Valentine treatment would be just the thing for him. But she didnt have an irrigator with her; it was much too large for her purse. It also required the considerable cooperation of the patient.'

const high29 = 'What she did have with her was a scalpel; she carried it with her all the time. She had not stolen it from surgery, either; it was a castaway scalpel with a deep nick taken out of the point (it had probably been dropped on the floor, or in a sink)--it was no good for fine work, but it was not for fine work that Jenny wanted it. At first it had slashed up the little silk pockets of her purse. Then she found part of an old thermometer container that slipped over the head of the scalpel, capping it like a fountain pen. It was this cap she removed when the soldier moved into the seat beside her and stretched his arm along the armrest they were (absurdly) meant to share. His long hand dangled off the end of the armrest; it twitched like the flank of a horse shuddering flies away. Jenny kept her hand on the scalpel inside her purse; with her other hand, she held the purse tightly in her white lap. She was imagining that her nurses uniform shone like a holy shield, and for some perverse reason this vermin beside her had been attracted by her light. My mother, Garp wrote, went through her life on the lookout for pursesnatchers and snatch-snatchers. In the theater, it was not her purse that the soldier wanted. He touched her knee. Jenny spoke up fairly clearly. Get your stinking hand off me, she said. Several people turned around. Oh, come on, the soldier moaned, and his hand shot quickly under her uniform; he found her thighs locked tightly together--he found his whole arm, from his shoulder to his wrist, suddenly sliced open like a soft melon. Jenny had cut cleanly through his insignia and his shirt, cleanly through his skin and muscles, baring his bones at the joint of his elbow. (If Id wanted to kill him, she told the police, later, Id have slit his wrist. Im a nurse. I know how people bleed.) The soldier screamed. On his feet and falling back, he swiped at Jennys head with his uncut arm, boxing her ear so sharply that her head sang. She pawed at him with the scalpel, removing a piece of his upper lip the approximate shape and thinness of a thumbnail. (I was not trying to slash his throat, she told the police, later. I was trying to cut his nose off but I missed.) Crying, on all fours, the soldier groped his way to the theater aisle and headed toward the safety of the light in the lobby. Someone else in the theater was whimpering, in fright. Jenny wiped her scalpel on the movie seat, returned it to her purse, and covered the blade with the thermometer cap. Then she went to the lobby, where keen wailings could be heard and the manager was calling through the lobby doors over the dark audience, Is there a doctor here? Please Is someone a doctor? Someone was a nurse, and she went to lend what assistance she could. When the soldier saw her, he fainted; it was not really from loss of blood. Jenny knew how facial wounds bled; they were deceptive. The deeper gash on his arm was of course in need of immediate attention, but the soldier was not bleeding to death. No one but Jenny seemed to know that--there was so much blood, and so much of it was on her white nurses uniform. They quickly realized she had done it. The theater lackeys would not let her touch the fainted soldier, and someone took her purse from her. The mad nurse The crazed slasher Jenny Fields was calm. She thought it was only a matter of waiting for the true authorities to comprehend the situation. But the police were not very nice to her, either. You been dating this guy long? the first one asked her, en route to the precinct station. And another one asked her, later, But how did you know he was going to attack you? He says he was just trying to introduce himself. Thats a real mean little weapon, honey, a third told her. You shouldnt carry something like that around with you. Thats asking for trouble. So Jenny waited for her brothers to clear things up. They were law-school men from Cambridge, across the river. One was a law student, the other one taught in the law school. Both, Garp wrote, were of the opinion that the practice of law was vulgar, but the study of it was sublime. They were not so comforting when they came. Break your mothers heart, said one. If youd only stayed at Wellesley, said the other. A girl alone has to protect herself, Jenny said. What could be more proper? But one of her brothers asked her if she could prove that she had not had previous relations with the man. Confidentially, whispered the other one, have you been dating this guy long? Finally, things were cleared up when the police discovered that the soldier was from New York, where he had a wife and child. He had taken a leave in Boston and, more than anything else, he feared the story would get back to his wife. Everyone seemed to agree that would be awful--for everyone--so Jenny was released without charges. When she made a fuss that the police had not given her back her scalpel, one of her brothers said, For Gods sake, Jennifer, you can steal another one, cant you? I didnt steal it, Jenny said. You should have some friends, a brother told her. At Wellesley, they repeated. Thank you for coming when I called you, Jenny said. Whats a family for? one said. Blood runs thick, said the other. Then he paled, embarrassed at the association--her uniform was so besmirched. Im a good girl, Jenny told them. Jennifer, said the older one, and her lifes earliest model--for wisdom, for all that was right. He was rather solemn. He said, Its best not to get involved with married men. We wont tell Mother, the other one said. And certainly not Father said the first. In an awkward attempt at some natural warmth, he winked at her--a gesture that contorted his face and for a moment convinced Jenny that her lifes earliest model had developed a facial tic. Beside the brothers was a mailbox with a poster of Uncle Sam. A tiny soldier, all in brown, was climbing down from Uncle Sams big hands. The soldier was going to land on a map of Europe. The words under the poster said: SUPPORT OUR BOYS Jennys oldest brother looked at Jenny looking at the poster. And dont get involved with soldiers, he added, though in a very few months he would be a soldier himself. He would be one of the soldiers who wouldnt come home from the war. He would break his mothers heart, an act he once spoke of with distaste. Jennys only other brother would be killed in a sailboat accident long after the war was over.'

const high30 = 'He would be drowned several miles offshore from the Fields family estate at Dogs Head Harbor. Of his grieving wife, Jennys mother would say, Shes still young and attractive, and the children arent obnoxious. At least not yet. After a decent time, Im sure shell be able to find someone else. It was to Jenny that her brothers widow eventually spoke, almost a year after the drowning. She asked Jenny if she thought a decent time had passed and she could begin whatever had to be begun to find someone else. She was anxious about offending Jennys mother. She wondered if Jenny thought it would be all right to emerge from mourning. If you dont feel like mourning, what are you mourning for? Jenny asked her. In her autobiography, Jenny wrote: That poor woman needed to be told what to feel. That was the stupidest woman my mother said she ever met, Garp wrote. And she had gone to Wellesley. But Jenny Fields, when she said good-night to her brothers at her small rooming house near Boston Mercy, was too confused to be properly outraged. She was also sore--her ear, where the soldier had cuffed her, hurt her; and there was a deep muscle cramp between her shoulder blades, which made it hard for her to sleep. She thought she must have wrenched something in there when the theater lackeys had grabbed her in the lobby and pulled her arms behind her back. She remembered that hot-water bottles were supposed to be good for sore muscles and she got out of bed and went to her closet and opened one of her mothers gift packages. It was not a hot-water bottle. That had been her mothers euphemism for something her mother couldnt bring herself to discuss. In the package was a douche bag. Jennys mother knew what they were for, and so did Jenny. She had helped many patients at the hospital use them, though at the hospital they were not much used to prevent pregnancies after love-making; they were used for general feminine hygiene, and in venereal cases. To Jenny Fields a douche bag was a gentler, more commodious version of the Valentine irrigator. Jenny opened all her mothers packages. In each one was a douche bag. Please use it, dear her mother had begged her. Jenny knew that her mother, though she meant well, assumed that Jennys sexual activity was considerable and irresponsible. No doubt, as her mother would put it, since Wellesley. Since Wellesley, Jennys mother thought that Jenny was fornicating (as she would also put it) to beat the band.'

And his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow.

The fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping. Then Jack Lawtons yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going home for the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventyseven to seventysix.  It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the haha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwells Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from. Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey   Where the abbots buried him.   Canker is a disease of plants,   Cancer one of animals. It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuffbox for Wellss seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and slimy the water had been A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.  A voice cried far out on the playground:  —All in  Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:  —All in All in  The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them, glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering the fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said:  —We all know why you speak. You are McGlades suck.  Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefects false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only louder.  To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.  And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.  It was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said:  —Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York Go ahead, Lancaster  Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums but he tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnalls face looked very black but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:  —Right. Bravo Lancaster The red rose wins. Come on now, York Forge ahead  Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on. Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnalls voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.  The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the scullions apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.  All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fathers and mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed to be at home and lay his head on his mothers lap. But he could not: and so he longed for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed.'

const high31 = 'He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said:  —Whats up? Have you a pain or whats up with you?  —I dont know, Stephen said.  —Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks white. It will go away.  —O yes, Stephen said.  But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at night. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.  Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and the tables of the third line. And every single fellow had a different way of walking.  He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door with some boys and Simon Moonan was knotting his false sleeves. He was telling them something about Tullabeg.  Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and said:  —Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed?  Stephen answered:  —I do.  Wells turned to the other fellows and said:  —O, I say, heres a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before he goes to bed.  The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, laughing. Stephen blushed under their eyes and said:  —I do not.  Wells said:  —O, I say, heres a fellow says he doesnt kiss his mother before he goes to bed.  They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wellss mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wellss face. He did not like Wellss face. It was Wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuffbox for Wellss seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had been And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.  The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?  Sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the number pasted up inside from seventyseven to seventysix. But the Christmas vacation was very far away: but one time it would come because the earth moved round always.  There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dantes press, the brush with the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself.  He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could not learn the names of places in America. Still they were all different places that had different names. They were all in different countries and the countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and the world was in the universe.  He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written there: himself, his name and where he was. Stephen Dedalus   Class of Elements   Clongowes Wood College   Sallins   County Kildare   Ireland   Europe   The World   The Universe That was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod had written on the opposite page: Stephen Dedalus is my name,   Ireland is my nation.   Clongowes is my dwellingplace   And heaven my expectation. He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. Then he read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own name. That was he: and he read down the page again. What was after the universe? Nothing. But was there anything round the universe to show where it stopped before the nothing place began? It could not be a wall but there could be a thin thin line there all round everything. It was very big to think about everything and everywhere. Only God could do that. He tried to think what a big thought that must be but he could only think of God. God was Gods name just as his name was Stephen. _Dieu_ was the French for God and that was Gods name too; and when anyone prayed to God and said Dieu then God knew at once that it was a French person that was praying. But though there were different names for God in all the different languages in the world and God understood what all the people who prayed said in their different languages still God remained always the same God and Gods real name was God.  It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel his head very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. He wondered which was right, to be for the green or for the maroon, because Dante had ripped the green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with her scissors and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered if they were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and his father and Mr Casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle'

const high32 = 'Charles were on no side. Every day there was something in the paper about it.  It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.  The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was cold night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea was cold day and night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and dark under the seawall beside his fathers house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.  The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the responses: O Lord, open our lips   And our mouths shall announce Thy praise.   Incline unto our aid, O God   O Lord, make haste to help us There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the halfdoor of a cottage with a child in her arms, as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. But, O, the road there between the trees was dark You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was.  He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayer. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees.  Visit, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this habitation and drive away from it all the snares of the enemy. May Thy holy angels dwell herein to preserve us in peace and may Thy blessing be always upon us through Christ our Lord. Amen.  His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. He told his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and then kneel and say his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell when he died. He rolled his stockings off and put on his nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his prayers quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his shoulders shaking as he murmured'
